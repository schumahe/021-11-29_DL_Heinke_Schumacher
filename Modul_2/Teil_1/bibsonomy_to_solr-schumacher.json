Preference for classical music\r\n\tsignificantly influenced specificity and intensity ratings across\r\n\tcategories. Absorption trait significantly correlated with arousal\r\n\tratings only.

In the context of large musical databases and Electronic Music Distribution, genre is therefore a crucial metadata for the description of music content. However, genre is intrinsically ill-defined and attempts at defining genre precisely have a strong tendency to end up in circular, ungrounded projections of fantasies. Is genre an intrinsic attribute of music titles, as, say, tempo? Or is genre a extrinsic description of the whole piece? In this article, we discuss the various approaches in representing musical genre, and propose to classify these approaches in three main categories: manual, prescriptive and emergent approaches. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and illustrate our study with results of the Cuidado IST project.",

Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly-used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself \u00e4 composer seduced into mathematics,\" Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at http://www.musimathics.com Publisher description of vol. 1. Volume 2 of Musimathics continues the story of music engineering begun in volume 1, focusing on the digital and computational domain. Loy goes deeper into the mathematics of music and sound, beginning with digital audio, sampling, and binary numbers, as well as complex numbers and how they simplify representation of musical signals. Chapters cover the Fourier transform, convolution, filtering, resonance, the wave equation, acoustical systems, sound synthesis, the short-time Fourier transform, and the wavelet transform. These subjects provide the theoretical underpinnings of today's music technology. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio Publisher description.",

They employ different input representations, aiming to exploit melodic or harmonic characteristics of songs and yield promising performances. In this work, we propose a comparative study of these different representations and show that systems combining melodic and harmonic features drastically outperform those relying on a single input representation. We illustrate how these features complement each other with both quantitative and qualitative analyses. We finally investigate various fusion schemes and propose methods yielding state-of-the-art performances on two publicly-available large datasets., FY is supported by the MIP-Frontiers project, the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 765068, and EG by TROMPA, the Horizon 2020 project 770376-2.",

        "abstract": "Many people intuitively sense that there is a connection between mathematics and music. If nothing else, both involve counting. There is, of course, much more to the association. David Wright's book is an investigation of the interrelationships between mathematics and music, reviewing the needed background concepts in each subject as they are encountered. Along the way, readers will augment their understanding of both mathematics and music. The text explores the common foundations of the two subjects, which are developed side by side. Musical and mathematical notions are brought together, such as scales and modular arithmetic, intervals and logarithms, tone and trigonometry, and timbre and harmonic analysis. When possible, discussions of musical and mathematical notions are directly interwoven. Occasionally the discourse dwells for a while on one subject and not the other, but eventually the connection is established, making this an integrative treatment of the two subjects. The book is a text for a freshman level college course suitable for musically inclined or mathematically inclined students, with the intent of breaking down any apprehension that either group might have for the other subject. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The mathematical prerequisites are a high-school level familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, functions, and graphs. Musically, the student should have had some exposure to musical staffs, standard clefs, and key signatures, though all of these are explained in the text Publisher description.",

In this study, 2532 participants responded to a questionnaire asking them to state their musical preference and also to provide data on various aspects of their lifestyle (namely media preferences, leisure interests and music usage). Numerous associations existed between musical preference and these aspects of participants' lifestyle. The nature of these associations was consistent in part with previous research on taste publics concerning the high-culture-low-culture divide, such that fans of  high-art' and  low-art' musical styles demonstrated a preference for other  high-art' and  low-art' media objects respectively, as reflected in reading, TV and radio preferences, and leisure activities.",

We define (i) on a global and a country level, (ii) by several network centrality measures such as Jaccard index among users\u2019 connections, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, and (iii) by country and age information. Using the LFM-1b dataset of listening events of Last.fm users, we are able to uncover country-dependent differences in consumption of mainstream music as well as in user behavior with respect to social ties and users\u2019 centrality. We could identify that users inclined to mainstream music tend to have stronger connections than the group of less mainstreamy users. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that users typically have less connections within a country than cross-country ones, with the first being stronger social ties, though. Results will help building better user models of listeners and in turn improve personalized music retrieval and recommendation algorithms.",

It   further explores the influences of musical preference and absorption trait on induced emotion. Twenty-five excerpts of classical music representing `happiness',   `sadness', `fear', `anger' and `peace' were presented individually to 99 adult participants. Participants rated the intensity of felt emotions as well as the   pleasantness and arousal induced by each excerpt. Mean intensity ratings of target emotions were highest for 20 out of 25 excerpts. Pleasantness and arousal ratings  led to three main clusters within the two-dimensional circumplex space. Preference for classical music significantly influenced specificity and intensity ratings   across categories. Absorption trait significantly correlated with arousal ratings only. In sum, instrumental music appears effective for the induction of basic  emotions in adult listeners. However, careful screening of participants in terms of their musical preferences should be mandatory.",

        "abstract": "Promoting diversity in the music sector is widely discussed on the media. While the major problem may lie deep in our society, music information retrieval contributes to promoting diversity or may create unequal opportunities for artists. For example, considering the known problem of popularity bias in music recommendation, it is important to investigate whether the short head of popular music artists and the long tail of less popular ones show similar patterns of diversity---in terms of, for example, age, gender, or ethnic origin---or the popularity bias amplifies a positive or negative effect.\r\nI advocate for reasonable opportunities for artists---for (currently) popular artists and artists in the long-tail alike---in music recommender systems. In this work, I represent the position that we need to develop a deep understanding of the biases and inequalities because it is the essential basis to design approaches for music recommendation that provide reasonable opportunities. Thus, research needs to investigate the various reasons that hinder equal opportunity and diversity in music recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Cover song detection is a very relevant task in Music Information Retrieval\r\n(MIR) studies and has been mainly addressed using audio-based systems. Despite\r\nits potential impact in industrial contexts, low performances and lack of\r\nscalability have prevented such systems from being adopted in practice for\r\nlarge applications. In this work, we investigate whether textual music\r\ninformation (such as metadata and lyrics) can be used along with audio for\r\nlarge-scale cover identification problem in a wide digital music library. We\r\nbenchmark this problem using standard text and state of the art audio\r\nsimilarity measures. Our studies shows that these methods can significantly\r\nincrease the accuracy and scalability of cover detection systems on Million\r\nSong Dataset (MSD) and Second Hand Song (SHS) datasets. By only leveraging\r\nstandard tf-idf based text similarity measures on song titles and lyrics, we\r\nachieved 35.5% of absolute increase in mean average precision compared to the\r\ncurrent scalable audio content-based state of the art methods on MSD. These\r\nexperimental results suggests that new methodologies can be encouraged among\r\nresearchers to leverage and identify more sophisticated NLP-based techniques to\r\nimprove current cover song identification systems in digital music libraries\r\nwith metadata.",

        "abstract": "Live computer music is the perfect medium for generative music systems, for non-linear compositional constructions and for interactive manipulation of sound processing. Unfortunately, much of the complexity of these real-time systems is lost on a potential audience, excepting those few connoisseurs who sneak round the back to check the laptop screen. An artist using powerful software like SuperCollider or PD cannot be readily distinguished from someone checking their e-mail whilst DJ-ing with iTunes. Without a culture of understanding of both the laptop performer and current generation graphical and text-programming languages for audio, audiences tend to respond most to often gimmicky controllers, or to the tools they have had more exposure to - the (yawn) superstar DJs and their decks. This article attempts to convey the exciting things that are being explored with algorithmic composition and interactive synthesis techniques in live performance. The reasons for building generative music systems and the forms of control attainable over algorithmic processes are investigated. Direct manual control is set against the use of autonomous software agents. In line with this, four techniques for software control during live performance are introduced, namely presets, previewing, autopilot, and the powerful method of live coding. Finally, audio-visual collaboration is discussed.",

Examining the different stages of their reasoning, one can find out some slight deviations betwen the empiric data and their theoretical expression, allowing one to question the validity of their systems. The scientific analysis of intervals now used in contemporary Iran leads to regard all the attempts made up to now as more or less arbitrary reductions of data resisting any rigorous formulation.",

Audio signals were taken from sources such as MP3 player smart phone laptop etc and these signals were first amplified using LM386 IC and then transferred into an analog input of Arduino for FFT processing. To give out signals for DC pump motors digital output pins was used. With various frequency band turning on and off the DC motors and LED systems was created the lighting and water spray effects which should go well along with showed music. The response of this foundation is analysed for different audio frequency range and pump motor control was emphasised and fountain model is designed for domestic usages.

        "abstract": "Optical music recognition (OMR) is a form of structured document image analysis where symbols overlaid on the conventional five-line stave are isolated and identified so that the music can be played through a MIDI system, or edited in a music publishing-system. Traditionally OMR systems have had recognition techniques hard-coded in software. This paper describes a system that has been designed to be extensible without the need to change the systems source code. Extensibility is achieved by providing tools for music recognition that are used to tailor the system to suit the type of music being recognised. The tools include a selection of methods for identifying staves and isolating objects from them, methods for describing and identifying primitive musical shapes, and a grammar for specifying the relationships between the shapes that are recognised. The system is flexible enough to work with different publishers symbol sets, and even with different types of music notation, such as the square-note notation used in early music (13 Refs.) recognition; music; optical character recognition; pattern recognition",

        "abstract": "This article examines implication and expectation in music, taking as its starting point music-theoretical and music-psychological work ranging from the seminal thinking of Meyer (1956, 1967, 1973) to its development in the theories of Narmour (1990, 1992) and subsequent empirical and theoretical investigation by, for example, Schellenberg (1996, 1997), Von Hippel and Huron (2000) and Aarden (2003). Other psychological approaches, such as those adopted by Jones (1981, 1982, 1992) and Bharucha (1987, 1999), are considered too. The most important contemporary reference point, however, is Huron's latest extended thinking on expectation (forthcoming), which summarizes, consolidates and develops a wide range of theoretical and empirical work in the field. These diverse perspectives on musical implication and expectation are analysed using the `zygonic' theory of musical understanding recently developed by Ockelford (for example, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2005a, 2005b). This holds that the cognition of structure stems from a sense of derivation arising from the presence of repetition in certain contexts. Using this framework, a new, composite theory of expectation in music is developed, which acknowledges the potential implications of three sources of regularity in music: patterns within groups of notes, and between them -- as encoded in short-term memory and long-term, both veridicallyand schematically.Finally, the phenomenological relevance of the new model to `typical' listening experiences is discussed, and the need for future empirical work is set out.",

        "abstract": "Following a review of the model of similarity perception, cue abstraction and categorization, developed and empirically tested by Deli\u00e8ge and others over the last decade or so, it is proposed that the notion of perceived derivationmay be a key additional element in the cognition of musical structure. Evidence is sought in the re-analysis of recent empirical work and through the identification of structures that appear to challenge the sufficiency of Deli\u00e8ge's model. The issue is contextualized through a discussion of the concepts of similarity, sameness and salience, utilizing contemporary thinking in cognitive psychology, philosophy and music theory -- strands of thought which are drawn together through Ockelford's `zygonic' theory of music-structural understanding. This leads to the formulation of a new, composite account of how musical structure is processed, in which similarity, salience, derivation, categorization and schematization are shown to function in an integrated way.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown earlier that deep aesthetic appreciation of music\n\tcan induce an altered state of consciousness, a phenomenon often\n\treferred to as musicogenic epilepsy. The change in EEG, during such\n\ta state, has been characterized by large number of spikes, symptomatic\n\tto epilepsy, along, with changes in background EEG. The fractal dimension\n\tof EEG was found to reduce during this (epoch) period. Morphological\n\tvariations in ECG, causing a possible sympathetic burst on autonomic\n\tsystem (ANS), has also been reported. In the present study, the neural\n\trepresentation of the music, causing change in the state of mind,\n\thas been found out using a biophysically defensible model of auditory\n\tprocessing. This involves analysis, transduction and reduction in\n\tthe cochlear mechanism generating the auditory spectrum. The latter\n\tis again taken as input to the response function (RF) of the neuron\n\tand the output of this filter is the neuronal representation of the\n\tinput signal (music). This cortical representation turns out to be\n\ta ripple, i.e. near-sinusoid on the log-frequency axis, indicating\n\ta broad-based spike in the time domain. This might have deeper implications\n\ton the study of altered state of consciousness because spikes in\n\tEEG and the `clouding' of consciousness (say during grandmal/petitmal\n\tepilepsy) are established phenomena",

But more urgently, the current revolution in the music industry represents major opportunities and challenges for recommendation systems in general. Recommendation systems are now central to music streaming platforms, which are rapidly increasing in listenership and becoming the top source of revenue for the music industry. It is increasingly more common for a music listener to simply access music than to purchase and own it in a personal collection. In this scenario, recommendation calls no longer for a one-shot recommendation for the purpose of a track or album purchase, but for a recommendation of a listening experience, comprising a very wide range of challenges, such as sequential recommendation, or conversational and contextual recommendations. Recommendation technologies now impact all actors in the rich and complex music industry ecosystem (listeners, labels, music makers and producers, concert halls, advertisers, etc.). To highlight these developments, we focus on three use cases: automatic playlist generation, context-aware music recommendation, and recommendation in the creative process of music making.",

The\r\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention,\r\nhas achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require\r\nmaintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also\r\nbe well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance,\r\nhowever, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for\r\nrepresenting relative positional information in the Transformer modulate\r\nattention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical\r\nfor long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity\r\nfor intermediate relative information is quadratic in the sequence length. We\r\npropose an algorithm that reduces their intermediate memory requirement to\r\nlinear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a\r\nTransformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate\r\nminute-long compositions (thousands of steps, four times the length modeled in\r\nOore et al., 2018) with compelling structure, generate continuations that\r\ncoherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate\r\naccompaniments conditioned on melodies. We evaluate the Transformer with our\r\nrelative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and\r\nPiano-e-Competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.",

In the first stage, we estimate the\n\tperceptual salience of immanent accents (phrasing, metrical, melodic,\n\tharmonic) in the musical score. In the second, we manipulate timing,\n\tdynamics and other performance parameters in the vicinity of immanent\n\taccents (e. g., getting slower and/or louder near an accent). Phrasing\n\tand metrical accents emerge from the hierarchical structure of phrasing\n\tand meter; their salience depends on the hierarchical levels that\n\tthey demarcate, and their salience. Melodic accents follow melodic\n\tleaps; they are strongest at contour peaks and (to a lesser extent)\n\tvalleys; and their salience depends on the leap interval and the\n\tdistance of the target tone from the local mean pitch. Harmonic accents\n\tdepend on local dissonance (roughness, non-harmonicity, non-diatonicity)\n\tand chord/key changes. The algorithm is under development and is\n\tbeing tested by comparing its predictions with music analyses, recorded\n\tperformances and listener evaluations.",

        "abstract": "With this paper, we want to stimulate the discussion about technologies for inter-operation between various music datasets and collections. Among the many standards for music representation, IEEE 1599 is the only one which was born with the exact purpose of representing the heterogeneous structures of music documents, granting full synchronization of all the different aspects of music (audio recordings, sheet music images, symbolic representations, musicological analysis, etc). We propose the adoption of IEEE 1599 as an interoperability framework between different collections for advanced music experience, musicological applications, and Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In the years to come, the format will undergo a review process aimed at providing an updated/improved version. It is now the perfect time, for all the stakeholders, to come together and discuss how the format can evolve to better support their requirements, enhancing its descriptive strength and available tools. Moreover, this standard can be profitably applied to any field that requires multi-layer and synchronized descriptions.",

        "abstract": "Piano playing is an integral skill in music education in which students require mastery of the fundamental concepts and principles in terms of piano instruction, as well as in teaching learning processes. In the part of teaching, which is the piano pedagogy, facilitating learning in playing the piano serves as a ground to develop individuals on a particular skill in each grade level in accordance with the learning competencies enumerated in the Music Curriculum Guide by the Department of Education. This article aimed to describe the context of the functional approach of piano accompaniment to make an easy way of learning the piano accompaniment in the most convenient and fastest time, as well as to accompany certain music or composition in minimal learning time. The practical way of learning piano skills is the observation and use of musical elements through their functions. In this approach, there are four identified components in learning and playing the piano accompaniment musical elements and functions, musical patterns, musical piano accompaniment styles, and musical piano composition. By this process of learning, gradually, the manner of playing, the style, the elements, and other components of piano accompaniment will be combined to modify and to discover the aesthetic value and characteristics of music composition as well as the wisdom of the music itself.

        "abstract": "Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.",

First, we adapt the LDA model to capture music taste from listening activities across users and identify both the groups of songs associated with the specific taste and the groups of listeners who share the same taste. Second, we define a graphical model that takes into account listening sessions and captures the listening moods of users in the community. Our session model leads to groups of songs and groups of listeners with similar behavior across listening sessions and enables faster inference when compared to the LDA model. Our experiments with the data from an online media site demonstrate that the session model is better in terms of the perplexity compared to two other models: the LDA-based taste model that does not incorporate cross-session information and a baseline model that does not use latent groupings of songs.",

        "abstract": "Few types of signal streams are as ubiquitous as music. Here we consider the problem of extracting essential ingredients of music signals, such as well-defined global temporal structure in the form of nested periodicities (or meter). Can we construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style? Because recurrent neural networks can in principle learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard recurrent neural networks (RNNs) often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has succeeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as timing &amp; counting and learning of context sensitive languages. In the current study we show that LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. We present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and we believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.",

In the normal mode, a player sees a list of semantically related words (e.g., \u2018Instruments\u2019, \u2018Emotions \u2019 \u2018Usages\u2019) and is asked to pick the best and worst word to describe a song. In the freestyle mode, a user is asked to suggest a new word that describes the music. Each player receives realtime feedback on the agreement amongst all players. We show that we can use the data collected during a twoweek pilot study of Listen Game to learn a supervised multiclass labeling (SML) model which can annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs from a database of audio content.",

Is genre an intrinsic attribute of music titles, as, say, tempo? Or is genre a extrinsic description of the whole piece? In this article, we discuss the various approaches in representing musical genre, and propose to classify these approaches in three main categories: manual, prescriptive and emergent approaches. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and illustrate our study with results of the Cuidado IST project. 1.",

        "abstract": "Cross-culturally, most music is tonal in the sense that one particular\n\ttone, called the tonic, provides a focus around which the other tones\n\tare organized. The specific organizational structures around the\n\ttonic show considerable diversity. Previous studies of the perceptual\n\tresponse to Western tonal music have shown that listeners familiar\n\twith this musical tradition have internalized a great deal about\n\tits underlying organization. Krumhansl and Shepard (1979) developed\n\ta probe tone method for quantifying the perceived hierarchy of stability\n\tof tones. When applied to Western tonal contexts, the measured hierarchies\n\twere found to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts. In the\n\tpresent study, the probe tone method was used to quantify the perceived\n\thierarchy of tones of North Indian music. Indian music is tonal and\n\thas many features in common with Western music. One of the most significant\n\tdifferences is that the primary means of expressing tonality in Indian\n\tmusic is through melody, whereas in Western music it is through harmony\n\t(the use of chords). Indian music is based on a standard set of melodic\n\tforms (called rags), which are themselves built on a large set of\n\tscales (thats). The tones within a rag are thought to be organized\n\tin a hierarchy of importance. Probe tone ratings were given by Indian\n\tand Western listeners in the context of 10 North Indian rags. These\n\tratings confirmed the predicted hierarchical ordering. Both groups\n\tof listeners gave the highest ratings to the tonic and the fifth\n\tdegree of the scale. These tones are considered by Indian music theorists\n\tto be structurally significant, as they are immovable tones around\n\twhich the scale system is constructed, and they are sounded continuously\n\tin the drone. Relatively high ratings were also given to the vadi\n\ttone, which is designated for each rag and is given emphasis in the\n\tmelody. The ratings of both groups of listeners generally reflected\n\tthe pattern of tone durations in the musical contexts. This result\n\tsuggests that the distribution of tones in music is a psychologically\n\teffective means of conveying the tonal hierarchy to listeners whether\n\tthey are familiar with the musical tradition. Beyond this, only the\n\tIndian listeners were sensitive to the scales (thats) underlying\n\tthe rags. For Indian listeners, multidimensional scaling of the correlations\n\tbetween the rating profiles recovered the theoretical representation\n\tof scales described by theorists of Indian music.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED\n\tAT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Today's global economic development has brought many changes in the lives of women. The women in today's time have broken away from the beaten track and are exploring new vistas of economic participation as entrepreneurs. They at times get largely discouraged by their own family members and peers who cannot see a woman's worth. In the last few decades there have been many extensive literature's on work stress but among women entrepreneurs, knowledge about coping with work stress is still inadequate in comparison. The present study is designed to extend the influential sources on stress among women entrepreneurs and how music can help to heal stress amongst them.

        "abstract": "Definitive embeddings remain a fundamental challenge of computational\r\nmusicology for symbolic music in deep learning today. Analogous to natural\r\nlanguage, music can be modeled as a sequence of tokens. This motivates the\r\nmajority of existing solutions to explore the utilization of word embedding\r\nmodels to build music embeddings. However, music differs from natural languages\r\nin two key aspects: (1) musical token is multi-faceted -- it comprises of\r\npitch, rhythm and dynamics information; and (2) musical context is\r\ntwo-dimensional -- each musical token is dependent on both melodic and harmonic\r\ncontexts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution by proposing a\r\nnovel framework named PiRhDy that integrates pitch, rhythm, and dynamics\r\ninformation seamlessly. PiRhDy adopts a hierarchical strategy which can be\r\ndecomposed into two steps: (1) token (i.e., note event) modeling, which\r\nseparately represents pitch, rhythm, and dynamics and integrates them into a\r\nsingle token embedding; and (2) context modeling, which utilizes melodic and\r\nharmonic knowledge to train the token embedding. A thorough study was made on\r\neach component and sub-strategy of PiRhDy. We further validate our embeddings\r\nin three downstream tasks -- melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, and\r\ngenre classification. Results indicate a significant advancement of the neural\r\napproach towards symbolic music as well as PiRhDy's potential as a pretrained\r\ntool for a broad range of symbolic music applications.",

In this\n\tpaper, we present advanced methods on how the lyrics domain of music\n\tcan be combined with the acoustic domain.

        "abstract": "Traditional research into the arts has almost always been based around the subjective judgment of human critics. The use of data mining tools to understand art has great promise as it is objective and operational. We investigate the distribution of music from around the world: geographical ethnomusicology. We cast the problem as training a machine learning program to predict the geographical origin of pieces of music. This is a technically interesting problem as it has features of both classification and regression, and because of the spherical geometry of the surface of the Earth. Because of these characteristics of the representation of geographical positions, most standard classification/regression methods cannot be directly used. Two applicable methods are K-Nearest Neighbors and Random forest regression, which are robust to the non-standard structure of data. We also investigated improving performance through use of bagging. We collected 1,142 pieces of music from 73 countries/areas, and described them using 2 different sets of standard audio descriptors using MARSYAS. 10-fold cross validation was used in all experiments. The experimental results indicate that Random forest regression produces significantly better results than KNN, and the use of bagging improves the performance of KNN. The best performing algorithm achieved a mean great circle distance error of 3,113 km.",

Tracing a history and pre-history of the metaphor and its usage sheds light on the eclipse of more richly textured models of music-making from previous eras as well as on an esthetic predicament within contemporary \u201chistoricist\u201d performance. The limitations of the metaphor suggest moving \u201cbeyond interpretation\u201d in favor of more experiential and intuitive notions of making music.",

In particular, we focused on stereotypes concerning fans' personalities (e.g. extraversion, emotional stability), personal qualities (e.g. political beliefs, athleticism), values (e.g. for peace, for wisdom), and alcohol and drug preferences (e.g. wine, hallucinogens). Previous research has shown that music is linked to a variety of psychological characteristics, that music is used to convey information about oneself to observers, and that observers can infer personality on the basis of music preferences. Guided by such research, we predicted and found that individuals have robust and clearly defined stereotypes about the fans of various music genres (Study 1), and that many of these music-genre stereotypes possess a kernel of truth (Study 2). Discussion focuses on the potential role of music-genre stereotypes in self-expression and impression formation.",

In two experiments,\n\twe asked whether bimusicalism exists as a phenomenon, and whether\n\tit can occur even without explicit formal training and extensive\n\tmusic-making. Everyday music listeners who had significant exposure\n\tto music of both Indian (South Asian) and Westerners traditions (IW\n\tlisteners) and listeners who had experience with only Indian or Western\n\tculture (I or W listeners) participated in recognition memory and\n\ttension judgment experiments where they listened to Western and Indian\n\tmusic. We found that while I and W listeners showed an in-culture\n\tbias, IW listeners showed equal responses to music from both cultures,\n\tsuggesting that dual mental and affective sensitivities can be extended\n\tto a nonlinguistic domain.",

        "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that cognitive functions, such\n\tas attention and memory, drive perception by tuning sensory mechanisms\n\tto relevant acoustic features. Long-term musical experience also\n\tmodulates lower-level auditory function, although the mechanisms\n\tby which this occurs remain uncertain. In order to tease apart the\n\tmechanisms that drive perceptual enhancements in musicians, we posed\n\tthe question: do well-developed cognitive abilities fine-tune auditory\n\tperception in a top-down fashion? We administered a standardized\n\tbattery of perceptual and cognitive tests to adult musicians and\n\tnon-musicians, including tasks either more or less susceptible to\n\tcognitive control (e.g., backward versus simultaneous masking) and\n\tmore or less dependent on auditory or visual processing (e.g., auditory\n\tversus visual attention). Outcomes indicate lower perceptual thresholds\n\tin musicians specifically for auditory tasks that relate with cognitive\n\tabilities, such as backward masking and auditory attention. These\n\tenhancements were observed in the absence of group differences for\n\tthe simultaneous masking and visual attention tasks. Our results\n\tsuggest that long-term musical practice strengthens cognitive functions\n\tand that these functions benefit auditory skills. Musical training\n\tbolsters higher-level mechanisms that, when impaired, relate to language\n\tand literacy deficits. Thus, musical training may serve to lessen\n\tthe impact of these deficits by strengthening the corticofugal system\n\tfor hearing.",

The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine current practices in music education enabling high school students to meet high school graduation as well as admission requirements for California's public universities; and (2) provide guidance to school districts as they develop courses designed for that purpose. Methodology. A questionnaire was designed to gather data concerning: (1) the number of non-ensemble courses offered at any given high school and the current approach or mode of instruction of each course offered; (2) teacher familiarity with the 1987 university admission requirements; (3) status of submitted curricula, both ensemble and non-ensemble at each high school; (4) teacher beliefs about whether or not schools should offer non-ensemble courses for the purpose of meeting the requirements; and (5) teacher values which pertain to the approach and mode of instruction of such non-ensemble courses and their willingness to teach such courses. This questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 200 teachers taken from the California Music Educators Association's mailing list of 842 high school teachers. Of the 200 questionnaires distributed, 124 (62.0\\%) of the questionnaires were returned. Conclusions. (1) Although non-ensemble courses are offered in many of the schools, such courses are often performance oriented, including courses for guitar and keyboard. Many students have difficulty finding non-ensemble courses that are not geared toward performance. (2) Most non-ensemble courses are geared toward students who already have a strong background in music since they include members of ensemble courses. Consequently, there are few opportunities for students who are not in ensembles to receive a musical education. (3) Teachers are aware of policies regarding admission requirements, but few have submitted curricula to the institutions for approval. Courses submitted were ensembles adapted to meet requirements without consideration for general non-participating students. (4) Teachers maintain that high schools should offer non-ensemble courses for general students. Most favored by teachers are courses emphasizing historically oriented music listening and music fundamentals taught via Keyboard/Technology. (5) A majority of teachers indicated that they are interested in teaching non-ensemble courses.

Analyses of digital traces typically aim to find user traits such as age, gender, and nationality to derive common preferences. We investigate to which extent the music listening habits of users of the social music platform Last.fm can be used to predict their age, gender, and nationality. We propose a feature modeling approach building on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for artist listening information and artist tags combined with additionally extracted features. We show that we can substantially outperform a baseline majority voting approach and can compete with existing approaches. Further, regarding prediction accuracy vs. available listening data we show that even one single listening event per user is enough to outperform the baseline in all prediction tasks. We also compare the performance of our algorithm for different user groups and discuss possible prediction errors and how to mitigate them. We conclude that personal information can be derived from music listening information, which indeed can help better tailoring recommendations, as we illustrate with the use case of a music recommender system that can directly utilize the user attributes predicted by our algorithm to increase the quality of it's recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Melody extraction algorithms aim to produce a sequence of frequency values corresponding to the pitch of the dominant melody from a musical recording. Over the past decade, melody extraction has emerged as an active research topic, comprising a large variety of proposed algorithms spanning a wide range of techniques. This article provides an overview of these techniques, the applications for which melody extraction is useful, and the challenges that remain. We start with a discussion of ?melody? from both musical and signal processing perspectives and provide a case study that interprets the output of a melody extraction algorithm for specific excerpts. We then provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of melody extraction algorithms based on the results of an international evaluation campaign. We discuss issues of algorithm design, evaluation, and applications that build upon melody extraction. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining challenges in melody extraction research in terms of algorithmic performance, development, and evaluation methodology.",

        "abstract": "Concatenative synthesis is a sample-based approach to sound creation used frequently in speech synthesis and, increasingly, in musical contexts. Unit selection, a key component, is the process by which sounds are chosen from the corpus of samples. With their ability to match target units as well as preserve continuity, Hidden Markov Models are often chosen for this task, but one common criticism is its singular path output which is considered too restrictive when variations are desired. In this article, we propose considering the problem in terms of k-Best path solving for generating alternative lists of candidate solutions and summarise our implementations along with some practical examples.",

        "abstract": "Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tends to focus on the analysis of audio\r\nsignals. Often, a single music recording is used as representative of a \"song\"\r\neven though different performances of the same song may reveal different\r\nproperties. A performance is distinct in many ways from a (arguably more\r\nabstract) representation of a \"song,\" \"piece,\" or musical score. The\r\ncharacteristics of the (recorded) performance -- as opposed to the score or\r\nmusical idea -- can have a major impact on how a listener perceives music. The\r\nanalysis of music performance, however, has been traditionally only a\r\nperipheral topic for the MIR research community. This paper surveys the field\r\nof Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from various perspectives, discusses its\r\nsignificance to the field of MIR, and points out opportunities for future\r\nresearch in this field.",

The approach is based on the rep- resentation\n\tof a collection of music scores with a graph structure, where terminal\n\tnodes directly describe the mu- sic content, internal nodes represent\n\tits incremental gen- eralization, and arcs denote the relationships\n\tamong them. The similarity between two melodies can be computed by\n\tanalyzing the graph structure and finding the shortest path between\n\tthe corresponding nodes inside the graph. Pre- liminary results in\n\tterms of music similarity are presented using a small test collection.",

However, there is a lack of large-scale symbolic dataset for\r\nclassical piano music. In this article, we create a GiantMIDI-Piano dataset\r\ncontaining 10,854 unique piano solo pieces composed by 2,786 composers. The\r\ndataset is collected as follows, we extract music piece names and composer\r\nnames from the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP). We search and\r\ndownload their corresponding audio recordings from the internet. We apply a\r\nconvolutional neural network to detect piano solo pieces. Then, we transcribe\r\nthose piano solo recordings to Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)\r\nfiles using our recently proposed high-resolution piano transcription system.\r\nEach transcribed MIDI file contains onset, offset, pitch and velocity\r\nattributes of piano notes, and onset and offset attributes of sustain pedals.\r\nGiantMIDI-Piano contains 34,504,873 transcribed notes, and contains metadata\r\ninformation of each music piece. To our knowledge, GiantMIDI-Piano is the\r\nlargest classical piano MIDI dataset so far. We analyses the statistics of\r\nGiantMIDI-Piano including the nationalities, the number and duration of works\r\nof composers. We show the chroma, interval, trichord and tetrachord frequencies\r\nof six composers from different eras to show that GiantMIDI-Piano can be used\r\nfor musical analysis. Our piano solo detection system achieves an accuracy of\r\n89\\%, and the piano note transcription achieves an onset F1 of 96.72\\%\r\nevaluated on the MAESTRO dataset. GiantMIDI-Piano achieves an alignment error\r\nrate (ER) of 0.154 to the manually input MIDI files, comparing to MAESTRO with\r\nan alignment ER of 0.061 to the manually input MIDI files. We release the\r\nsource code of acquiring the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset at\r\nhttps://github.com/bytedance/GiantMIDI-Piano.",

Recently, deep learning approaches have outperformed NMF methods in terms of separation quality and processing time, and there is scope to extend them with score information. In this paper, we propose a score-informed separation system for classical music that is based on deep learning. We propose a method to derive training features from audio files and the corresponding coarsely aligned scores for a set of classical music pieces. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) with the goal of estimating time-frequency masks for source separation. Our system is trained with synthetic renditions derived from the original scores and can be used to separate real-life performances based on the same scores, provided a coarse audio-to-score alignment. The proposed system achieves better performance (SDR and SIR) and is less computationally intensive than a score-informed NMF system on a dataset comprising Bach chorales., This work is partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under CASAS project (TIN2015-70816-R) and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Programme (MDM2015-0502).",

        "abstract": "The task of identifying emotions from a given music track has been an active\r\npursuit in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community for years. Music\r\nemotion recognition has typically relied on acoustic features, social tags, and\r\nother metadata to identify and classify music emotions. The role of lyrics in\r\nmusic emotion recognition remains under-appreciated in spite of several studies\r\nreporting superior performance of music emotion classifiers based on features\r\nextracted from lyrics. In this study, we use the transformer-based approach\r\nmodel using XLNet as the base architecture which, till date, has not been used\r\nto identify emotional connotations of music based on lyrics. Our proposed\r\napproach outperforms existing methods for multiple datasets. We used a robust\r\nmethodology to enhance web-crawlers' accuracy for extracting lyrics. This study\r\nhas important implications in improving applications involved in playlist\r\ngeneration of music based on emotions in addition to improving music\r\nrecommendation systems.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems can be used to help users discover novel items and explore new tastes, for example in music genre exploration. However, little work has studied how to improve users\u2019 understandability and acceptance of the novel items as well as support users to explore a new domain. In this paper, we investigate how two different visualizations and mood control influence the perceived control, informativeness and understandability of a music genre exploration tool, and further to improve the helpfulness for new music genre exploration. Specifically, we compare a bar chart visualization used by earlier work to a contour plot which allows users to compare their musical preferences with both the recommended tracks as well as the new genre. Mood control is implemented with two sliders to set a preferred mood on energy and valence features (that correlate with psychological mood dimensions). In the online user study, mood control was manipulated between subjects, and the visualizations were compared within subjects. During the study (N=102), we measured users\u2019 subjective perceptions, experiences and the interactions with the system. Our results show that the contour plot visualization is perceived more helpful to explore new genres than the bar chart visualization, as the contour plot is perceived to be more informative and understandable. Users spent significantly more time and used the mood control more in the contour plot than in the bar chart visualization. Overall, our results show that the contour plot visualization combined with mood control serves as the most helpful way for new music genre exploration, because the mood control is easier to understand and use when made transparent via an informative visualization.",

Modern human composers similarly strive\n                 to create intelligent algorithmic music composition\n                 systems that can follow prespecified rules, learn\n                 appropriate patterns from a collection of melodies, or\n                 evolve to produce output more perfectly matched to some\n                 aesthetic criteria. Here we review recent efforts aimed\n                 at each of these three types of algorithmic\n                 composition.

Cerebral blood flow changes were measured in response to subject-selected music that elicited the highly pleasurable experience of \"shivers-down-the-spine\" or \"chills.\" Subjective reports of chills were accompanied by changes in heart rate, electromyogram, and respiration. As intensity of these chills increased, cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in reward/motivation, emotion, and arousal, including ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. These brain structures are known to be active in response to other euphoria-inducing stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs of abuse. This finding links music with biologically relevant, survival-related stimuli via their common recruitment of brain circuitry involved in pleasure and reward.",

Though these systems are promising, there is a need for a better understanding of the role of user preferences and user profiles. The development of taxonomies for different aspects of a musical audio-mining system aims at bridging the gap between system development and user interactive interfacing. In the first part of this paper, the need for user-dependent taxonomy development is addressed and an experiment in spontaneous user behavior is described, based on 72 users and 1148 vocal queries. Statistical analysis provides insight into the characteristics of vocal querying and possible useful concepts. In the second part of the paper, it is described how categories and concepts from the statistical analysis have been used for the refinement of taxonomies that address user interactive interfacing and feature extraction.",

        "abstract": "Taking David Lewin's work as a point of departure, this essay uses geometry to reexamine familiar music-theoretical assumptions about intervals and transformations. Section 1 introduces the problem of \"transportability,\" noting that it is sometimes impossible to say whether two different directions--located at two different points in a geometrical space--are \"the same\" or not. Relevant examples include the surface of the earth and the geometrical spaces representing n-note chords. Section 2 argues that we should not require that every interval be defined at every point in a space, since some musical spaces have natural boundaries. It also notes that there are spaces, including the familiar pitch-class circle, in which there are multiple paths between any two points. This leads to the suggestion that we might sometimes want to replace traditional pitch-class intervals with paths in pitch-class space, a more fine-grained alternative that specifies how one pitch class moves to another. Section 3 argues that group theory alone cannot represent the intuition that intervals have quantifiable sizes, proposing an extension to Lewin's formalism that accomplishes this goal. Finally, Section 4 considers the analytical implications of the preceding points, paying particular attention to questions about voice leading.",

Since the 1970s, music theorists have modeled musical transpositionand inversion in terms of an action of the dihedral group of order 24. Morerecently music theorists have found an intriguing second way that the dihedralgroup of order 24 acts on the set of major and minor chords. We illustrate bothgeometrically and algebraically how these two actions are dual. Bothactions and their duality have been used to analyze works of music as diverseas Hindemith and the Beatles.",

The community's growing interest in feature and\r\nend-to-end learning is however restrained by the limited availability of large\r\naudio datasets. By releasing the FMA, we hope to foster research which will\r\nimprove the state-of-the-art and hopefully surpass the performance ceiling\r\nobserved in e.g. genre recognition (MGR). The data is made of 106,574 tracks,\r\n16,341 artists, 14,854 albums, arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of 161\r\ngenres, for a total of 343 days of audio and 917 GiB, all under permissive\r\nCreative Commons licenses. It features metadata like song title, album, artist\r\nand genres; user data like play counts, favorites, and comments; free-form text\r\nlike description, biography, and tags; together with full-length, high-quality\r\naudio, and some pre-computed features. We propose a train/validation/test split\r\nand three subsets: a genre-balanced set of 8,000 tracks from 8 major genres, a\r\ngenre-unbalanced set of 25,000 tracks from 16 genres, and a 98 GiB version with\r\nclips trimmed to 30s.

        "abstract": "The effect of different levels of preintentional and intentional communication development on musical interaction with children with severe and multiple disabilities has not been explored in the music therapy literature. Aside from stage of communication development, what are the particular influences of disability on musical interaction with children who have preintentional and early intentional communication? A qualitative research project explored these issues. Ten school-aged children with severe and multiple disabilities participated in the project. The most common medical diagnosis was cerebral palsy. Analysis of video recordings and other data confirmed that the children's level of communication development was reflected in individual music therapy. Specifically, children at different levels of communication development varied in their abilities to initiate, anticipate, and sustain participation in turn taking, and to maintain attention to and engagement in the interaction. Both turn taking and playing and singing together were found to be important forms of communication during music therapy. Communication problems related to disability included: difficulties in using objects as a focus of joint attention, difficulties in interpreting the interactive environment, being sufficiently motivated to communicate, severely limited means of interaction, attaining and maintaining an appropriate level of arousal, and lack of interest in interaction and the outside environment. Further study of how music therapy can be related to general issues in communication for individuals with severe and multiple disabilities is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Music listening is an inherently cultural behavior, which may be shaped by users\u2019 backgrounds and contextual characteristics. Due to geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors as well as friendship networks, users in different countries may have different music preferences. Investigating cultural-socio-economic factors that might be associated with between-country differences in music preferences can facilitate music information retrieval, contribute to the prediction of users\u2019 music preferences, and improve music recommendation in cross-country contexts. However, previous literature provides limited empirical evidence of the relationships between possible cross-country differences on a wide range of socio-economic aspects and those in music preferences. To bridge this research gap, and drawing on a large-scale dataset, LFM-1b, this study examines the possible relationship between cross-country differences in artist, album, and genre listening frequencies as well as the cross-country distance in geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, cultural, and friendship connections using the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate: (1) there is no significant relationship between geographical and economic distance on album, artist, and genre preferences\u2019 distance at the country-level; (2) the cross-country distance of three cultural dimensions (masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence) is positively associated with both the album and artist preferences distances; (3) the between-country distance in main languages has a positive relationship with the album, artist, and genre preferences distances across countries; (4) the density of friendship connections among countries negatively correlates to the cross-country preference distances in terms of artist and genre. Findings from this study not only expand knowledge of factors related to music preferences at the country level, but also can be integrated into real-world music recommendation systems that consider country-level music preferences.",

In order to assist users in this task, several mechanisms have been proposed to incorporate novelty awareness into music recommender systems. In this paper, we complement these efforts by investigating how the music preferences of users are affected by two different aspects of novel artists, namely familiarity and mainstreamness. We collected historical data from Last.fm users, a popular online music discovery service, to investigate how these aspects of novel artists relate to the preferences of music listeners for novel artists. The results of this analysis suggests that the users tend to cluster according to their novelty related preferences. We then\r\nconducted a comprehensive study on these groups, from where we derive implications and useful insights for developers of music retrieval services.",

The first study was conducted at a school-clinic specialized in the care of children with autism in north-western Mexico, and the second study was conducted at an early education center in San Diego, California. Our preliminary results indicate that BendableSound is successful when used in both contexts to support specific development areas.

However, the few moments in which he does reflect on popular music are highly revealing. In this article I provide a comprehensive overview and a critical analysis of Said's public statements on popular music, and argue that these strongly create dissonance with his interventions in postcolonial theory and politics. More specifically, I argue that in these reflections on popular music Said voices problematic elitist, orientalist, and universalist claims. Consequently, Said's notion of popular music constitutes perhaps the most antagonistic aspect of his oeuvre.",

Pattern recognition is the major bottleneck holding up automation of this process. Human beings who know music can easily read a handwritten score, but without musical knowledge, even people cannot correctly perceive the markings in a handwritten score. This paper reports an experiment in which knowledge of music, a highly structured domain is applied to extract primitive musical features. This experiment shows that if the domain of image processing is well defined, significant improvements in low-level segmentations can be achieved (17 Refs.) recognition; computerised picture processing; expert systems; music",

In-depth interviews were used to explore the meaning, importance and function of music for 52 older Australians living in the community   aged 60 years and older. The findings revealed that music provides people with ways of understanding and developing their self-identity; connecting with others;  maintaining well-being; and experiencing and expressing spirituality. The results show how music contributes to positive ageing by providing ways for people to maintain positive self-esteem, feel competent, independent, and avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness. The study highlights the need to be better informed about how music can facilitate and sustain older people's well-being.",

Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.",

Section 1 introduces the problem of \"transportability,\" noting that it is sometimes impossible to say whether two different directions--located at two different points in a geometrical space--are \"the same\" or not. Relevant examples include the surface of the earth and the geometrical spaces representing n-note chords. Section 2 argues that we should not require that every interval be defined at every point in a space, since some musical spaces have natural boundaries. It also notes that there are spaces, including the familiar pitch-class circle, in which there are multiple paths between any two points. This leads to the suggestion that we might sometimes want to replace traditional pitch-class intervals with paths in pitch-class space, a more fine-grained alternative that specifies how one pitch class moves to another. Section 3 argues that group theory alone cannot represent the intuition that intervals have quantifiable sizes, proposing an extension to Lewin's formalism that accomplishes this goal. Finally, Section 4 considers the analytical implications of the preceding points, paying particular attention to questions about voice leading.",

While much has been written about the\r\norigin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather\r\nthan scientific in nature. To rectify this we investigate the US Billboard Hot\r\n100 between 1960 and 2010. Using Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and\r\ntext-mining tools we analyse the musical properties of ~17,000 recordings that\r\nappeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic\r\nand timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based\r\nclassification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity\r\nand disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural\r\nchange. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual\r\nor punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it\r\ndid so with particular rapidity during three stylistic \"revolutions\" around\r\n1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to\r\na quantitative science of cultural change.",

        "abstract": "In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately~17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic \u2018revolutions\u2019 around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.",

        "abstract": "Choral music recordings are a particularly challenging target for source separation due to the choral blend and the inherent acoustical complexity of the \u2018choral timbre\u2019. Due to the scarcity of publicly available multi-track choir recordings, we create a dataset of synthesized Bach chorales. We apply data augmentation to alter the chorales so that they more faithfully represent music from a broader range of choral genres. For separation we employ Wave-U-Net, a time-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) originally proposed for vocals and accompaniment separation. We show that Wave-U-Net outperforms a baseline implemented using score-informed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization). We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a \u2018score-guided\u2019 model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to study source separation of choral music.",

While previous works were mostly based on\r\naudio for music discovery and playlists generation, we take advantage of our\r\nsynchronized lyrics dataset to combine text representations and music features\r\nin a novel way; we therefore introduce the Synchronized Lyrics Emotion Dataset.\r\nUnlike other approaches that randomly exploited the audio samples and the whole\r\ntext, our data is split according to the temporal information provided by the\r\nsynchronization between lyrics and audio. This work shows a comparison between\r\ntext-based and audio-based deep learning classification models using different\r\ntechniques from Natural Language Processing and Music Information Retrieval\r\ndomains. From the experiments on audio we conclude that using vocals only,\r\ninstead of the whole audio data improves the overall performances of the audio\r\nclassifier. In the lyrics experiments we exploit the state-of-the-art word\r\nrepresentations applied to the main Deep Learning architectures available in\r\nliterature. In our benchmarks the results show how the Bilinear LSTM classifier\r\nwith Attention based on fastText word embedding performs better than the CNN\r\napplied on audio.",

Adopting a perceptual view of musical 'voice' that corresponds\n\tto the notion of auditory stream, a computational model is developed\n\tthat splits a musical score (symbolic musical data) into different\n\tvoices. A single 'voice' may consist of more than one synchronous\n\tnotes that are perceived as belonging to the same auditory stream;\n\tin this sense, the proposed algorithm, may separate a given musical\n\twork into fewer voices than the maximum number of notes in the greatest\n\tchord (e.g. a piece consisting of four or more concurrent notes may\n\tbe separated simply into melody and accompaniment). This is paramount,\n\tnot only in the study of auditory streaming per se, but also for\n\tdeveloping MIR systems that enable pattern recognition and extraction\n\twithin musically pertinent 'voices' (e.g. melodic lines).

A secondary purpose was to determine whether there were any differences in ratings between choral and instrumental music education majors. Participants (28 choral music education majors and 44 instrumental music education majors from a large western university) listened to 10 excerpts of high-quality children's choral performances and rated them on pitch accuracy rhythmic accuracy, tone quality expressiveness, and overall impression, using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Participants were assigned to one of two groups. The only difference between the groups was that, if Group 1 listened to an excerpt that was 20 seconds long Group 2 listened to that same excerpt for 60 seconds, and vice versa. Results of a three-way ANOVA with repeated measures indicate there were significant interactions between major and excerpt length (F (1, 64) = 6.06, p = .01, partial \u00ce\u00b7\u00c2\u00b2 = .08) and between piece and excerpt length (F (9, 576) = 2.39, p = .01, partial \u00ce\u00b7\u00c2\u00b2 -.03). Participants rated excerpts that were 60 seconds long slightly higher than excerpts that were 20 seconds long There were no significant differences between the ratings of instrumental and choral music education majors, although instrumental majors tended to rate excerpts higher than choral majors.",

Theoretically, the study builds on the sociology of culture and education in the tradition of Bourdieu and some of his successors, and its methodological design is that of a comprehensive survey of the entire corpus of academic theses produced within the Norwegian music field. On this basis, the authors examine what forms of popular music have been included and excluded respectively, how this aesthetic and cultural expansion has found its legitimate scholarly expression, and which structural forces seem to govern the processes of academisation of popular music in the Norwegian context. The results show that popular music to a large extent has been successfully academised, but also that this process has led to some limitations of academic openness as well as the emergence of new power hierarchies.",

This chapter focuses on empirical research of music performance and related matters. Most of this research is concerned with Western tonal music and mainly art music. Excellence in music performance involves two major components like a genuine understanding of what the music is about, its structure and meaning, and a complete mastery of the instrumental technique. Evaluation of performance included many studies which are reviewed earlier. Evaluation occurs in the everyday activity of music critics, music teachers, and musicians. An overall evaluation is considered as a weighted function of the evaluations in the specific aspects. In order to maintain the tempo and to achieve perceived synchrony, musicians should therefore play a small amount ahead of the beat they hear. With sharp attacks the delay is less, and instruments with sharp attacks may therefore serve as \u201cbeat-definers\u201d for the rest of an ensemble. In addition, some attempts are made to predict evaluation of music performances from the physical characteristics of the performances.",

Stimuli consisted of homologues of Mandarin high rising\n\t(T2) and high level (T1) tones, and a linear rising ramp (T2L). One\n\tcondition involved a between-category contrast (T1/T2), the other,\n\ta within-category contrast (T2L/T2).

Chinese, however, were less accurate than\n\tnonnatives in overt discrimination of T2L and T2. Taken together,\n\tthese findings suggest that experience-dependent effects to pitch\n\tcontours are domain-general and not driven by linguistic categories.\n\tYet specific differences in long-term experience in pitch processing\n\tbetween domains (music vs. language) may lead to gradations in cortical\n\tplasticity to pitch contours.",

        "abstract": "Studies of the biology of music (as of language) are highly interdisciplinary\n\tand demand the integration of diverse strands of evidence. In this\n\tpaper, I present a comparative perspective on the biology and evolution\n\tof music, stressing the value of comparisons both with human language,\n\tand with those animal communication systems traditionally termed\n\t\"song\". A comparison of the \"design features\" of music with those\n\tof language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important\n\tdifferences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic,\n\trather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core\n\tof music and language. I next review various animal communication\n\tsystems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird\n\tand whale \"song\") or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming).\n\tA crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals\n\t(like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter,\n\tape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build\n\tupon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates\n\tand mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species\n\tsince our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of\n\tvocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological\n\tand neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling\n\tsystems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents\n\ta fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I\n\tnext discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution,\n\tconcluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental\n\tmusic is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end\n\twith a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding\n\tthat no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate\n\tto explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions\n\tabout the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively\n\tand are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology.\n\tIn contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends\n\tfor our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music.",

Significant improvement\n\ton the spatial-temporal test was found for the keyboard group only.\n\tNo group improved significantly on the spatial recognition tests.\n\tThe magnitude of the spatial-temporal improvement from keyboard training\n\twas greater than one standard deviation of the standardized test\n\tand lasted at least one day, a duration traditionally classified\n\tas long term. This represents an increase in time by a factor of\n\tover 100 compared to a previous study in which listening to a Mozart\n\tpiano sonata primed spatial-temporal reasoning in college students.\n\tThis suggests that music training produces long-term modifications\n\tin underlying neural circuitry in regions not primarily concerned\n\twith music and might be investigated using EEG. We propose that an\n\timprovement of the magnitude reported may enhance the learning of\n\tstandard curricula, such as mathematics and science, that draw heavily\n\tupon spatial-temporal reasoning.",

        "abstract": "This article is a study of melodic expectancy in North Sami yoiks,\n\ta style of music quite distinct from Western tonal music. Three different\n\tapproaches were taken. The first approach was a statistical style\n\tanalysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis\n\tdetermined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone\n\ttransitions. It also identified style characteristics, such as pentatonic\n\torientation, the presence of two reference pitches, the frequency\n\tof large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible\n\tmelodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment\n\tin which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three\n\tgroups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture,\n\tthe second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned\n\tsome yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar\n\twith yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations\n\t(for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on\n\tgeneral style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks\n\twas found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture.\n\tThe third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network\n\tmodels of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, T. (1997).\n\tSelf-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer). One model was\n\ttrained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral experiment\n\tincluding the correct continuation tone, while another was trained\n\twith a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The convergence\n\tof the three approaches showed that both listeners and the SOM model\n\tare influenced by the statistical distributions of tones and tone\n\tsequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided evidence supporting\n\ta core set of psychological principles underlying melody formation\n\twhose relative weights appear to differ across musical styles.",

        "abstract": "To appropriately adapt to constant sensory stimulation, neurons in\n\tthe auditory system are tuned to various acoustic characteristics,\n\tsuch as center frequencies, frequency modulations, and their combinations,\n\tparticularly those combinations that carry species-specific communicative\n\tfunctions. The present study asks whether such tunings extend beyond\n\tacoustic and communicative functions to auditory self-relevance and\n\texpertise. More specifically, we examined the role of the listening\n\tbiography--an individual's long term experience with a particular\n\ttype of auditory input--on perceptual-neural plasticity. Two groups\n\tof expert instrumentalists (violinists and flutists) listened to\n\tmatched musical excerpts played on the two instruments (J.S. Bach\n\tPartitas for solo violin and flute) while their cerebral hemodynamic\n\tresponses were measured using fMRI. Our experimental design allowed\n\tfor a comprehensive investigation of the neurophysiology (cerebral\n\themodynamic responses as measured by fMRI) of auditory expertise\n\t(i.e., when violinists listened to violin music and when flutists\n\tlistened to flute music) and nonexpertise (i.e., when subjects listened\n\tto music played on the other instrument). We found an extensive cerebral\n\tnetwork of expertise, which implicates increased sensitivity to musical\n\tsyntax (BA 44), timbre (auditory association cortex), and sound-motor\n\tinteractions (precentral gyrus) when listening to music played on\n\tthe instrument of expertise (the instrument for which subjects had\n\ta unique listening biography). These findings highlight auditory\n\tself-relevance and expertise as a mechanism of perceptual-neural\n\tplasticity, and implicate neural tuning that includes and extends\n\tbeyond acoustic and communication-relevant structures.",

        "abstract": "This thesis aims at developing techniques which support users in accessing and discovering music. The main part consists of two chapters. Chapter 2 gives an introduction to computational models of music similarity. The combination of different approaches is optimized and the largest evaluation of music similarity measures published to date is presented. The best combination performs significantly better than the baseline approach in most of the evaluation categories. A particular effort is made to avoid overfitting. To cross-check the results from the evaluation based on genre classification a listening test is conducted. The test confirms that genre-based evaluations are suitable to efficiently evaluate large parameter spaces. Chapter 2 ends with recommendations on the use of similarity measures. Chapter 3 describes three applications of such similarity measures. The first application demonstrates how music collections can be organized and visualized so that users can control the aspect of similarity they are interested in. The second application demonstrates how music collections can be organized hierarchically into overlapping groups at the artist level. These groups are summarized using words from web pages associated with the respective artists. The third application demonstrates how playlists can be generated which require minimum user input.",

Different parameters concerning feature extraction, selection, processing and classification have a strong impact on the categorization quality. Since it is very difficult to design a deterministic approach which provides the efficient parameter tuning, we haven chosen a heuristic approach. In our work we apply and compare different evolution strategies for the optimization of feature selection and consolidation using three pre-defined personal user categories. Concepts of local search operators with domain-specific knowledge and self-adaptation are examined. Several suggestions based on an empirical study are discussed and ideas for future work are given.",

        "abstract": "Pitch, together with other midlevel music features such as rhythm and timbre, holds the promise of bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics for music understanding. This paper investigates the pitch estimation of a piano music signal by exemplar-based sparse representation. A note exemplar is a segment of a piano note, stored in the dictionary. We first describe how to represent a segment of the piano music signal as a linear combination of a small number of note exemplars from a large note exemplar dictionary and then show how the sparse representation problem can be solved by -regularized minimization. The proposed approach incorporates tuning factor estimation, note candidate selection, and hidden-Markov-model-based smoothing into the estimation process to improve accuracy. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed approach does not require retraining for a new piano. Instead, only a dozen notes of the new piano are needed. This feature is computationally attractive and avoids intense manual labeling. The system performance is evaluated using 70 classical music recordings of two real pianos under different recording conditions. The results show that the proposed system outperforms four state-of-the-art systems.",

This condition appears to be very rare even among composers and musicians. I present here a detailed self-analysis of musical imagery for the purpose of defining the psychological features of a perpetual music track. I have music running through my head almost constantly during waking hours, consisting of a combination of recently-heard pieces and distant pieces that spontaneously pop into the head. Imagery consists mainly of short musical fragments that get looped repeatedly upon themselves. Corporeal manifestations of imagery occur in the form of unconscious finger movements whose patterns correspond to the melodic contour of the imagined piece. Musical dreams occur every week or two, and contain a combination of familiar and originally- composed music. These results are discussed in light of theories of imagery, consciousness, hallucination, obsessive cognition, and most especially the notion that acoustic consciousness can be split into multiple parallel streams.",

        "abstract": "One major challenge in using statistical sequence learning methods\n\tin the domain of music lies in bridging the long timelags that separate\n\timportant musical events. Consider, for example, the chord changes\n\tthat convey the basic structure of a pop song. A sequence learner\n\tthat cannot predict chord changes will almost certainly not be able\n\tto generate new examples in a musical style or to categorize songs\n\tby style. Yet, it is surprisingly difficult for a sequence learner\n\tto bridge the long timelags necessary to identify when a chord change\n\twill occur and what its new value will be. This is the case because\n\tchord changes can be separated by dozens or hundreds of intervening\n\tnotes. One could solve this problem by treating chords as being special\n\t(as did Mozer, NIPS 1991). But this is impractical---it requires\n\tchords to be labeled specially in the dataset, limiting the applicability\n\tof the model to non-labeled examples---and furthermore does not address\n\tthe general issue of nested temporal structure in music. I will briefly\n\tdescribe this temporal structure (known commonly as \"meter\") and\n\tpresent a model that uses to its advantage an assumption that sequences\n\tare metrical. The model consists of an autocorrelation-based filtration\n\tthat estimates online the most likely metrical tree (i.e. the frequency\n\tand phase of beat, measure, phrase &etc.) and uses that to generate\n\ta series of sequences varying at different rates. These sequences\n\tcorrespond to each level in the hierarchy. Multiple learners can\n\tbe used to treat each series separately and their predictions can\n\tbe combined to perform composition and categorization. I will present\n\tpreliminary results that demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.\n\tTime permitting I will also compare the model to alternate approaches.",

Accurate description is critical for achieving high-recall retrieval and access by patrons. This study considers the challenge of music description through content analysis of the popular music websites AllMusic.com and Last.fm. The goal of the research was to gain a better understanding of how users describe their music collections. The findings in this study illustrate that hierarchical vocabulary structures are clearly evident within the Last.fm folksonomy. The findings also show that tagging data is more reliable in representing musical genre/subject than previously speculated, indicating that with proper analysis and coding, social tag data could be harvested to provide genre-level metadata for popular music titles. The work presented here contributes a methodology for further study of this topic, specific to music folksonomies and vocabularies, which may also be useful for other disciplines.",

In this sense, similarity is used to propose labels\n\t(tags) to yet unlabeled songs, based on the content-based distance\n\tbetween them. The main goal of our work is to ease the process of\n\tannotating huge music collections, by using content-based similarity\n\tdistances as a way to propagate labels among songs.\n\tWe present two different experiments. The first one propagates labels\n\tthat are related with the style of the piece, whereas the second\n\texperiment deals with mood labels. On the one hand, our approach\n\tshows that using a music collection annotated at 40% with styles,\n\tand using content-based, the collection can be automatically annotated\n\tup to 78% (that is, 40% already annotated and the rest, 38%, only\n\tusing propagation), with a recall greater than 0.4. On the other\n\thand, for a smaller music collection annotated at 30% with moods,\n\tthe collection can be automatically annotated up to 65% (e.g. 30%\n\tplus 35% using propagation).",

        "abstract": "Games based on human computation are a valuable tool for collecting semantic information about images. We show how to transfer this idea into the music domain in order to collect high-quality semantic data for songs. We present Listen Game, a online, multiplayer game that measures the semantic relationship between music and words. In the normal mode, a player sees a list of semantically related words (e.g., \u2018Instruments\u2019, \u2018Emotions \u2019 \u2018Usages\u2019) and is asked to pick the best and worst word to describe a song. In the freestyle mode, a user is asked to suggest a new word that describes the music. Each player receives realtime feedback on the agreement amongst all players. We show that we can use the data collected during a twoweek pilot study of Listen Game to learn a supervised multiclass labeling (SML) model which can annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs from a database of audio content.",

        "abstract": "This article presents the implications, objectives and initial results of a current ethnographic research project on music lovers. It looks at problems of theory and method posed by such research if it is not conceived only as the explanation of external determinisms, relating taste to the social origins of the amateur or to the aesthetic properties of the works. Our aim is, on the contrary, from long interviews and observations undertaken with music lovers, mostly in the classical field, to concentrate on gestures, objects, mediums, devices and relations engaged in a form of playing or listening, which amounts to more than the actualization of a taste `already there', for they are redefined during the action, with a result that is partly uncertain. This is why amateurs' attachments and ways of doing things can both engage and form subjectivities, rather than merely recording social labels, and have a history, irreducible to that of the taste for works.",

        "abstract": "Creative industries constantly strive for fame and popularity. Though highly desirable, popularity is not the only achievement artistic creations might ever acquire. Leaving a longstanding mark in the global production and influencing future works is an even more important achievement, usually acknowledged by experts and scholars. \u2018Significant\u2019 or \u2018influential\u2019 works are not always well known to the public or have sometimes been long forgotten by the vast majority. In this paper, we focus on the duality between what is successful and what is significant in the musical context. To this end, we consider a user-generated set of tags collected through an online music platform, whose evolving co-occurrence network mirrors the growing conceptual space underlying music production. We define a set of general metrics aiming at characterizing music albums throughout history, and their relationships with the overall musical production. We show how these metrics allow to classify albums according to their current popularity or their belonging to expert-made lists of important albums. In this way, we provide the scientific community and the public at large with quantitative tools to tell apart popular albums from culturally or aesthetically relevant artworks. The generality of the methodology presented here lends itself to be used in all those fields where innovation and creativity are in play.",

Results suggest that tagging, on average, leads to only very small increases in listening rates, and overall the data do",

It is also shown that an analysis of such kind \u2014 drawing on the t\u00e9chne of the making of music \u2014 is indispensable in order to shed light on the renewed relation of sound materials to musical form in electroacoustic music. Finally, the problem of whether the theoretical approach outlined here would lend itself to an outlook on normative aesthetics in the context of the presumed a\u2010normativity of postmodern intellectual endeavours is discussed.",

        "abstract": "When recommendations become increasingly personalized, users are often presented with a narrower range of content. To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization. Our goal is to investigate how individual traits such as musical sophistication (MS) and visual memory (VM) influence the satisfaction of the visualization for perceived music diversity, overall usability, and support to identify blind-spots. We hypothesize that music experts, or people with better visual memory, will perceive higher diversity in ComBub than SimBub. A within-subjects user study (N=83) is conducted to compare these two visualizations. Results of our study show that participants with high MS and VM tend to perceive significantly higher diversity from ComBub compared to SimBub. In contrast, participants with low MS perceived significantly higher diversity from SimBub than ComBub; however, no significant result is found for the participants with low VM. Our research findings show the necessity of considering individual traits while designing diversity-aware interfaces.",

Starting from either the representation of the symbolic score or the audio recording of a performance, a hidden Markov model is built to represent the corresponding music work. The model can be used to identify unknown recordings and to align them with the corresponding score. Experimental evaluation using a collection of classical music recordings showed that this approach is effective in terms of both identification and alignment. The methodology can be exploited as the core component for a set of tools aimed at accessing and actively listening to a music collection.",

Within a few seconds the system is able to identify the piece that is being played, and the position within the piece. It then tracks the performance over time via a robust score following algorithm. Furthermore, the system continuously re-evaluates its current position hypotheses within a database of scores and is capable of detecting arbitrary \u2018jumps\u2019 by the performer. The system can be of use in multiple ways, e.g. for piano rehearsal, for live visualisation of music, and for automatic page turning. At the conference, we will demonstrate this system live on stage. If possible, we would also like to encourage (hobby-)pianists in the audience to try the companion themselves. Additionally, we will give an outlook on our efforts to extend this approach to classical music in general, including heavily polyphonic orchestral music.",

        "abstract": "The usefulness and desirability of representation schemes which explicitly\n\tshow musical structure has often been commented upon. A particular\n\taim of music theory and analysis has been to describe and derive\n\tmusical structure, and this article discusses computational systems\n\tbased on this work. Six desirable properties of a structural representation\n\tare described: that it should be constructive, derivable, meaningful,\n\tdecomposable, hierarchical, and generative. Previous computational\n\twork based on the generative and reductional theories of Schenker\n\tand of Lerdahl and Jackendoff is examined in the light of these properties.\n\tProposals are made for a representational framework which promises\n\tthe desirable properties. The framework shares characteristics with\n\tearlier work but does not use pure trees as a representational structure,\n\tinstead allowing joining of branches in limited circumstances to\n\tmake directed acyclic graphs. Important issues in developing a representation\n\tscheme within this framework are discussed, especially concerning\n\tthe representation of polyphonic music, of rhythmic patterns, and\n\tof up-beats. An example is given of two alternative representations\n\twithin this framework of the same segment of music used to exemplify\n\tearlier work: the opening of the theme of Mozart's piano sonata in\n\tA major, K.331.",

        "abstract": "Most of our work in the humanities is increasingly driven by digital\n\ttechnology. Musicology is no exception and the field is undergoing\n\tthe same revolution as all disciplines in the humanities. There are\n\tat least two key areas in which digital technology is transforming\n\tresearch: access and scale. Technology, and the internet in particular,\n\thas radically changed how we can access data, but also how we can\n\tmake research results accessible to others. Correlatively, the scope\n\tof projects can be broadened to a completely new extent. What does\n\tthis mean for musicology? Scholars in musicology base their work\n\ton a wide range of materials. Since most of the music that forms\n\tour heritage in Western culture has been preserved in a text-based\n\tform, this is by far, the most widely used type of material for musicological\n\tstudies. Handwritten and printed sources constitute the core data,\n\tbut historical studies also rely on various types of textual and\n\tarchival material, be they letter writings, libretti, or inventories\n\tof diverse kind. These are essential for understanding the socio-economic\n\tcontext in which the music sources were written or produced and for\n\tbetter understanding of specific aspects, such as performance practice\n\tof the time. Performance practice study itself may also be based\n\ton sound recordings when focusing on relatively recent history, as\n\tit is often the case for studies in ethno-musicology or in folk-songs\n\t(Cook, 2010). Obtaining access to the sources has always been a struggle\n\tfor musicologists. Only a few years ago, studying a particular source\n\tmeant first locating the relevant sources using printed bibliographies,\n\twriting to the holding library, and then waiting for a microfilm\n\tto be prepared and sent out. The process could take months and be\n\tunpredictably expensive, with no guarantee of success. Such an obstacle\n\tseriously reduced the breadth of research musicologists could reasonably\n\tenvisage, with a consequent inclination toward close-reading approaches\n\ton a restricted set of sources. With the coming of the digital world,\n\tthe situation changed. Many resources are now available online, including\n\tthe bibliographic finding aids, which makes locating sources significantly\n\teasier. Collections are being digitized and made accessible online,\n\twhich greatly facilitates access to them for musicologists. This\n\tis also the case for secondary sources. Some projects are composer-specific,\n\tsuch as the Digital Archive of the Beethoven-Haus, others are repertoire-oriented,\n\tsuch as the digital image archive for medieval manuscripts (DIAMM)\n\tor based on a particular library collection, such as the Julliard\n\tManuscript Collection, to cite only three examples. In the archives,\n\tdigital cameras are often allowed and can be used to capture sources\n\tquickly. It is now straightforward for scholars to store thousands\n\tof images on their personal computer, in the cloud, or even share\n\tthem on community websites, although this in its turn raises new\n\tcopyright concerns. What other issues need to be addressed? Digital\n\taccess in musicology is still overwhelmingly linked to images. Several\n\timportant digital musicology research projects, such as the OCVE\n\tand the Edirom projects, focusing mostly on philological issues have\n\tbeen very successful in relying extensively on digital image resources\n\t(Bradley and Vetch, 2007; Bohl et al., 2011). However, digital musicology\n\tprojects that address a wide range of other issues, such as music\n\tanalysis or music searching, require access to the music itself in\n\tdigital form, are referred to as content-based resources. Musicology\n\thas never been behind other disciplines for experimenting with computational\n\tapproaches in these domains, quite on the Frontiers in Digital Humanities\n\t| www.frontiersin.org August 2015 | Volume 2 | Article 4 1 Pugin\n\tData in digital musicology contrary. However, obtaining or accessing\n\thigh quality datasets remains a serious hurdle, especially on a large\n\tscale, in a similar way to accessing sources a couple of decades\n\tago. It is a major barrier that needs to be removed if digital musicology\n\tresearch is to be taken to the next level. Several initiatives have\n\tlaid down the basis for large-scale content-based resources. First\n\tand foremost, the CCARH with its KernScores repository 1 , which\n\trepresents years of careful data creation and curation is made available\n\tfor research and is an invaluable contribution. The Josquin Research\n\tProject (JRP 2) at Stanford is a groundbreaking project that is currently\n\tbuilding a considerable dataset of pieces of Josquin des Prez and\n\tof other composers of the time (1400--1500). Another is the Electronic\n\tLocator of Vertical Interval Successions project at McGill Uni-versity\n\t(ELVIS 3). These two projects pursue similar goals and follow more\n\tor less comparable strategies: respectively creating or collecting\n\ta large collection of data and making it accessi-ble and analyzable\n\tby integrating state-of-the-art analysis tools Humdrum and Music21.\n\tTheir output in terms of counterpoint analysis is a breakthrough\n\tand opens new perspectives for style analysis and composition attribution.\n\tThe use of the harmonic and melodic intervals in ELVIS illuminates\n\tareas in which inno-vative research might be needed to address the\n\tquestion of how to represent music appropriately for such corpus-based\n\tanalysis undertakings. These are undoubtedly models to follow, but\n\tthey also illustrate how much still needs to be done. They hold a\n\tfew thousand pieces 4",

        "abstract": "Despite the consideration that musical parallelism is an important\n\tfactor for musical segmentation, there have been relatively few systematic\n\tattempts to describe exactly how it affects grouping processes. The\n\tmain problem is that musical parallelism itself is difficult to formalize.\n\tIn this study, a computational model that extracts melodic patterns\n\tfrom a given melodic surface is presented. Following the assumption\n\tthat the beginning and ending points of \u201csignificant\u201d repeating musical\n\tpatterns influence the segmentation of a musical surface, the discovered\n\tpatterns are used as a means to determine probable segmentation points\n\tof the melody. \u201cSignificant\u201d patterns are defined primarily in terms\n\tof frequency of occurrence and length of pattern. The special status\n\tof nonoverlapping, immediately repeating patterns is examined. All\n\tthe discovered patterns merge into a single \u201cpattern\u201d segmentation\n\tprofile that signifies points in the surface most likely to be perceived\n\tas points of segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed melodic\n\trepresentations and algorithms is tested against a series of melodic\n\tsurfaces illustrating both strengths and weaknesses of the approach.",

It focuses on the process of becoming established on the London \u2018scene\u2019, presenting qualitative interview data primarily with young workers seeking to build their careers. Musicians may make conscious decisions to pursue types of work which enable greater creative autonomy, but in doing so they may exacerbate fatalism about poor working conditions and undermine professional solidarity. The article also explores how pressures towards \u2018entrepreneurialism\u2019 in other forms of music work constitute further barriers to collective contestation of working conditions. Finally, it points towards types of music work where notions of professional economic interest have more traction.",

Musical sound sources, however, are often strongly correlated in time and frequency, and without additional knowledge about the sources, a decomposition of a musical recording is often infeasible. To simplify this complex task, various methods have recently been proposed that exploit the availability of a musical score. The additional instrumentation and note information provided by the score guides the separation process, leading to significant improvements in terms of separation quality and robustness. A major challenge in utilizing this rich source of information is to bridge the gap between high-level musical events specified by the score and their corresponding acoustic realizations in an audio recording. In this article, we review recent developments in score-informed source separation and discuss various strategies for integrating the prior knowledge encoded by the score.",

Additionally, a vast amount of studies already showed that personality impacts the way users perceive a recommender system. However, only recently, research has begun to investigate the effects of cognitive style on the perception of recommender systems. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether this cognitive style also affects the interaction strategies of users, and whether the reason why and when users want transparency is affected by this cognitive style. Additionally, despite the ubiquitous presence of recommender systems on mobile environments, no study has investigated the effect of transparency for mobile music recommender systems. In this paper, we report the results of a within-subject study (N=25) on a mobile music recommender system where we investigated the effect of cognitive styles on three different aspects: the interaction strategies with the different applications, the reasons why and when users want transparency and the effect of transparency on the trust of users. The results show that users with a rational thinking style put more effort in seeking the best recommendations and that they want scrutable explanations to adjust the recommendation. In contrast, intuitive thinkers only need explanations when they search for a very specific kind of music.",

We investigated the differences between Need For Cognition, Musical Sophistication and the Big Five personality traits. Results show empirical evidence of the differences between Musical Sophistication and Openness on both perception and gaze pattern.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.",

        "abstract": "Although most of the previous studies in writer identification in music scores assumed successful prior staff-line removal, this assumption does not hold when the music scores suffer from a certain level of degradation or deformation. The impact of staff-line removal on the result of writer identification in such documents is rather vague. In this study, we propose a novel writer identification method that requires no staff-line removal and no segmentation. Staff-line removal is virtually achieved without image processing, by dimensionality reduction with an autoencoder in Contour-Hinge feature space. The experimental result with a wide range of music manuscripts shows the proposed method can achieve favourable results without prior staff-line removal.",

        "abstract": "Writer identification from musical score documents is a challenging task due to its inherent problem of overlapping of musical symbols with staff-lines. Most of the existing works in the literature of writer identification in musical score documents were performed after a pre-processing stage of staff-lines removal. In this paper we propose a novel writer identification framework in musical score documents without removing staff-lines from the documents. In our approach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to model the writing style of the writers without removing staff-lines. The sliding window features are extracted from musical score-lines and they are used to build writer specific HMM models. Given a query musical sheet, writer specific confidence for each musical line is returned by each writer specific model using a log-likelihood score. Next, a log-likelihood score in page level is computed by weighted combination of these scores from the corresponding line images of the page. A novel Factor Analysis-based feature selection technique is applied in sliding window features to reduce the noise appearing from staff-lines which proves efficiency in writer identification performance. In our framework we have also proposed a novel score-line detection approach in musical sheet using HMM. The experiment has been performed in CVC-MUSCIMA data set and the results obtained show that the proposed approach is efficient for score-line detection and writer identification without removing staff-lines. To get the idea of computation time of our method, detail analysis of execution time is also provided.",

Other than most MRS research exploring MRS from a technical or from a consumers\u2019 perspective, this work focuses on the impact, value generation, challenges and opportunities for those, who contribute the core value, i.e. the artists. We outline the non-superstar artist\u2019s perspective on MRS, and explore the question if and how non-superstar artists may benefit from MRS to foster their professional advancement. Thereby, we explain several techniques how MRS generate recommendations and discuss their impact on non-superstar artists.",

However, formal definitions to quantify the level of mainstreaminess of a listener are rare and those available define mainstreaminess based on fractions between some kind of individual and global listening profiles. We argue, in contrast, that measures based on a modified version of the well-established Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as well as rank-order correlation coefficient may be better suited to capture the mainstreaminess of listeners. We therefore propose two measures adopting KL divergence and rank-order correlation and show, on a real-world dataset of over one billion user-generated listening events (LFM-1b), that music recommender systems can notably benefit when grouping users according to their level of mainstreaminess with respect to these two measures. This particularly holds for the frequently neglected listener group which is characterized by low mainstreaminess.",

In interviews with music artists, we identified that gender fairness is one of the artists\u2019 main concerns. They emphasized that female artists should be given more exposure in music recommendations. We analyze a widely-used collaborative filtering approach with two public datasets\u2014enriched with gender information\u2014to understand how this approach per-forms with respect to the artists\u2019 gender. To achieve gender balance, we propose a progressive re-ranking method that is based on the insights from the interviews. For the evaluation, we rely on a simulation of feedback loops and provide an in-depth analysis using state-of-the-art performance measures and metrics concerning gender fairness.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we introduce GACELA, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed to restore missing audio data with durations ranging between hundreds of milliseconds and a few seconds, i.e., to perform long-gap audio inpainting. While previous work either addressed shorter gaps or relied on exemplars by copying available information from other signal parts, GACELA addresses the inpainting of long gaps in two aspects. First, it considers various time scales of audio information by relying on five parallel discriminators with increasing resolution of receptive fields. Second, it is conditioned not only on the available information surrounding the gap, i.e., the context, but also on the latent variable of the cGAN. This addresses the inherent multi-modality of audio inpainting for such long gaps while providing the user with different inpainting options. GACELA was evaluated in listening tests on music signals of varying complexity and varying gap durations from 375 to 1500 ms. Under laboratory conditions, our subjects were often able to detect the inpainting. However, the severity of the inpainted artifacts was rated between not disturbing and mildly disturbing. GACELA represents a framework capable of integrating future improvements such as processing of more auditory-related features or explicit musical features. Our software and trained models, complemented by instructive examples, are available online.",

In this paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to improve the perceptual quality of signal components extracted in the context of music source separation. Specifically, we focus on decomposing polyphonic, mono-timbral piano recordings into the sound events that correspond to the individual notes of the underlying composition. Our separation technique is based on score-informed Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) that has been proposed in earlier works as an effective means to enforce a musically meaningful decomposition of piano music. However, the method still has certain shortcomings for complex mixtures where the tones strongly overlap in frequency and time. As the main contribution of this paper, we propose a restoration stage based on refined Wiener filter masks to score-informed NMF. Our idea is to introduce notewise soft masks created from a dictionary of perfectly isolated piano tones, which are then adapted to match the timbre of the target components. A basic experiment with mixtures of piano tones shows improvements of our novel reconstruction method with regard to perceptually motivated separation quality metrics. A second experiment with more complex piano recordings shows that further investigations into the concept are necessary for real-world applicability.",

Therefore, most people listen to music frequently and current music websites offer online listening services. However, because the semantic gap, it is not easy to effectively retrieve the user preferred music especially from a huge amount of music data. For this issue, this paper presents a personalized content-based music retrieval system that integrates techniques of user-filtering and query-refinement to achieve high quality of music retrieval. In terms of user-filtering, the new user interest can be inferred by the user similarities. In terms of query-refinement, the user interest can be guided to the potential search space by iterative feedbacks. The experimental results show the proposed method does improve the retrieval quality significantly.",

Classification of genre can be important to clarify some genuine fascinating issues, such as, making songs references, discovering related songs, finding societies who will like that particular song. The inspiration behind the research is to find the appropriate machine learning algorithm that predict the genres of music utilizing k nearest neighbor k NN and Support Vector Machine SVM . GTZAN dataset is the frequently used dataset for the classification music genre. The Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients MFCC is utilized to extricate features for the dataset. From results we found that k NN classifier gave more exact results compared to support vector machine classifier. If the training data is bigger than number of features, k NN gives better outcomes than SVM. SVM can only identify limited set of patterns. KNN classifier is more powerful for the classification of music genre. Seethal V | Dr. A.

In this work, we consider incorporating critiquing techniques into conversational systems to facilitate users\u2019 exploration of music recommendations. Thus, we have developed a music chatbot with three system variants, which are respectively featured with three different critiquing techniques, i.e., user-initiated critiquing (UC), progressive system-suggested critiquing (Progressive SC), and cascading system-suggested critiquing (Cascading SC). We conducted a between-subject study (N=107) to compare these three types of systems with regards to music exploration in terms of user perception and user interaction. Results show that both UC and SC are useful for music exploration, while users perceive higher diversity of recommendations with the system that offers Cascading SC and perceive more serendipitous with the system that offers Progressive SC. In addition, we find that the critiquing techniques significantly moderate the relationships between some interaction metrics (e.g., number of listened songs, number of dialogue turns) and users\u2019 perceived helpfulness and serendipity during music exploration.",

A detailed division of \"lovestyles\" has been proposed by the psychologist John Alan Lee, who suggests that there are six distinct styles of loving. Through a consideration of the application of his typology to the lyrics of popular songs, it can be seen that the categories he has identified have relevance musically, as well as socially and emotionally. When these insights are employed in the analysis of songs written and performed by the Beatles, significant differences are seen in the approach to love between the group's earlier and later material. It is argued that these are not random variations, but indications of the ways in which their personal experiences and professional evolution were reflected in the nature of their music.",

        "abstract": "The Beatles recorded two starkly different musical settings of John Lennon's controversial 1968 song \"Revolution\": One was released as a single, the other appeared on the White Album (as \"Revolution 1\"). Lennon's lyrics express deep skepticism about political radicalism, and the single, with its lines \"But when you talk about destruction/... you can count me out,\" incited rage among critics and activists on the Left. Lennon appears less opposed to violent protest in \"Revolution 1\" - recorded first, though released later-where he sang \"you can count me out-in.\" The reception of \"Revolution\" reflected a focus on the words and their apparent political meanings, largely ignoring the musical differences between the two recordings of the song. Moreover, the response to \"Revolution\" had much to do with public perceptions of the Beatles. Their rivals the Rolling Stones, seen as a more radical alternative voice, released the equally political \"Street Fighting Man\" at virtually the same moment in 1968. The much more favorable public reaction to the latter had at least as much to do with the way the bands themselves were perceived as with differences between the songs.",

        "abstract": "Unedited Largely a review of four publications examining aspects of popular music. Roy Shuker\u2019s dictionary \"Key concepts in popular music\" (London, 1998; RILM 1999-26276) is a solid and informed introduction to the central ideas of the field, although not without possible improvements. Keith Negus has a similarly eloquent exposition of recent debates in the field in his \"Popular music in theory\" (Cambridge, 1996; RILM 1997-5754), although the tacit assumption that the subject of musicology is \"the music itself\" is perhaps short-sighted in the light of recent semiotic discussions, and the careful organisation into single-word chapter headings causes a certain amount of repetition of material. Allan Moore\u2019s \"The Beatles: Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (Cambridge, 1997; RILM 1997-5755) has an excellent description of the historio-cultural context of the album, but its small format makes it impossible for some passages and assertions to be adequately expanded upon. Finally, John Covach and Graeme Boone\u2019s collection \u00dcnderstanding rock\" (New York and Oxford, 1997; RILM 1997-8775) is unlikely to be popular with popular music scholars, with its heavy reliance on analytical techniques. Taken as a set, these publications belie a pervasive underlying split between \"internal-analytical\" and \"external-poietic\" ways still awaiting unification.",

Our musical sequencing application is based on a framework for tangible interfaces with an architecture that is strongly inspired by the model-view-controller pattern. In addition, we developed a hardware setup for tangible interfaces and used MatraX for tracking markers. The sequencer is the first implementation based on this framework. It allows users to create music simply by moving tangibles on the table. The graphics engine Horde3D is used to visualize the user-interaction and to show the relationships between the tangible objects on the table, creating an appealing audio-visual experience. An evaluation with 37 first time users was conducted in order to discover the strong and the weak points of such tangible user interfaces, especially in the context of our application.",

        "abstract": "In the context of this PhD thesis, methods for automatically extracting music-related information from \nthe World Wide Web have been elaborated, implemented, and analyzed. Such information is becoming \nmore and more important in times of digital music distribution via the Internet as users of online music \nstores nowadays expect to be offered additional music-related information beyond the pure digital music \nfile. Novel techniques have been developed as well as existing ones refined in order to gather information \nabout music artists and bands from the Web. These techniques are related to the research fields of \nmusic information retrieval, Web mining, and information visualization. More precisely, on sets of Web \npages that are related to a music artist or band, Web content mining techniques are applied to address \nthe following categories of information: \n* similarities between music artists or bands \n* prototypicality of an artist or a band for a genre \n* descriptive properties of an artist or a band \n* band members and instrumentation \n* images of album cover artwork \nDifferent approaches to retrieve the corresponding pieces of information for each of these categories \nhave been elaborated and evaluated thoroughly on a considerable variety of music repositories. The \nresults and main findings of these assessments are reported. Moreover, visualization methods and user \ninteraction models for prototypical and similar artists as well as for descriptive terms have evolved from \nthis work. \nBased on the insights gained by the various experiments and evaluations conducted, the core applica- \ntion of this thesis, the Automatically Generated Music Information System (AGMIS) was build. AGMIS \ndemonstrates the applicability of the elaborated techniques on a large collection of more than 600,000 \nartists by providing a Web-based user interface to access a database that has been populated automat- \nically with the extracted information. Although AGMIS does not always give perfectly accurate results, \nthe automatic approaches to information retrieval have some advantages in comparison with those \nemployed in existing music information systems, which are either based on labor-intensive information \nprocessing by music experts or on community knowledge that is vulnerable to distortion of information.",

        "abstract": "The steep rise in music downloading over CD sales has created a major shift in the music industry away from physical media formats and towards online products and services. Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.",

Tests of non-humans provided little evidence of preferences for human music. However, prosodic features of speech ('motherese') influence affective behaviour of non-verbal infants as well as domestic animals, suggesting that features of music can influence the behaviour of non-human species. We incorporated acoustical characteristics of tamarin affiliation vocalizations and tamarin threat vocalizations into corresponding pieces of music. We compared music composed for tamarins with that composed for humans. Tamarins were generally indifferent to playbacks of human music, but responded with increased arousal to tamarin threat vocalization based music, and with decreased activity and increased calm behaviour to tamarin affective vocalization based music. Affective components in human music may have evolutionary origins in the structure of calls of non-human animals. In addition, animal signals may have evolved to manage the behaviour of listeners by influencing their affective state.",

        "abstract": "Models of the perceived distance between pairs of pitch collections are a core component of broader models of the perception of tonality as a whole. Numerous different distance measures have been proposed, including voice-leading, psychoacoustic, and pitch and interval class distances; but, so far, there has been no attempt to bind these different measures into a single mathematical framework, nor to incorporate the uncertain or probabilistic nature of pitch perception (whereby tones with similar frequencies may, or may not, be heard as having the same pitch).\nTo achieve these aims, we embed pitch collections in novel multi-way expectation arrays, and show how metrics between such arrays can model the perceived dissimilarity of the pitch collections they embed. By modeling the uncertainties of human pitch perception, expectation arrays indicate the expected number of tones, ordered pairs of tones, ordered triples of tones and so forth, that are heard as having any given pitch, dyad of pitches, triad of pitches, and so forth. The pitches can be either absolute or relative (in which case the arrays are invariant with respect to transposition).\nWe provide a number of examples that show how the metrics accord well with musical intuition, and suggest some ways in which this work may be developed.",

In contrast, this study examines the variety of ways that radio programmers answer this question by conceptualizing them as mediators between record companies and radio audiences. From interviews with programmers at commercial radio stations in the United States we identify key programming practices that programmers use to manage their stations' music formats and present a typology of repertoires of such practices. We then discuss the implications of each programming repertoire for stations' music formats and the structural conditions that promote the use of each programming repertoire. In conclusion, we consider the study's implications for understanding culture production in the commercial radio industry.\r\nER  -",

        "abstract": "Optical music recognition (OMR), the conversion of scanned pages of music into a musical database, has reached an exciting level of maturity. Like optical character recognition, it has now reached the point where the returns in accuracy from increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms appears saturated and more significant gains are being made from the application of structured a priori knowledge. This paper describes one such technique for improved staff line processing-the detection and subsequent correction of bowing in the staff lines, which is an important category given the significant source of music in book form. Two versions of the algorithm are tested: the first, based on mathematical morphology, has the added benefit of automatically fusing small breaks in staff lines, common for example in older works; the second, based on a flood-fill algorithm, requires a minor modification if fragmented staff lines are to be repaired. The correct detection and processing of staff lines is fundamental to OMR. Without adequate knowledge of staff line location, notation superimposed on the staves cannot be correctly separated, classified and processed (5 Refs.) recognition",

An XML language specifically designed for music like MX allows queries to be made directly on the thematic material. The main advantage of such a system is that it can handle symbolic, notational, and audio objects at the same time through a multilayered structure. On the model side, common music information retrieval methods do not take into account the inner structure of melodic themes and the metric relationships between notes.\r\n\r\nIn this article we deal with two main topics: a novel architecture based on a new XML language for music and a new model of melodic themes based on graph theory.\r\n\r\nThis model takes advantage of particular graph invariants that can be linked to melodic themes as metadata in order to characterize all their possible modifications through specific transformations and that can be exploited in filtering algorithms. We provide a similarity function and show through an evaluation stage how it improves existing methods, particularly in the case of same-structured themes.",

For instance,\r\n\tin 2007 only 1% of all digital tracks accounted for 80% of all sales.\r\n\tSimilarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50% of all album sales, and\r\n\t80% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There\r\n\tis a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend\r\n\tfrom the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail.\r\n\t\r\n\tCurrent music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict\r\n\twhat people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms\r\n\ttend to recommend popular -or well-known to the user- music, decreasing\r\n\tthe effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus\r\n\ton improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to\r\n\tmake accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy\r\n\tnext, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided\r\n\trecommendations.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn this Thesis we stress the importance of the user's perceived quality\r\n\tof the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity\r\n\tto predict -potentially-interesting and unknown music, hidden in\r\n\tthe tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems\r\n\tshould promote novel and relevant material (non-obvious recommendations),\r\n\ttaken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe main contributions of this Thesis are: <i>(i)</i> a novel network-based\r\n\tapproach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item\r\n\t(or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, <i>(ii)</i>\r\n\ta user-centric evaluation that measures the user's relevance and\r\n\tnovelty of the recommendations, and <i>(iii)</i> two prototype systems\r\n\tthat implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work.

        "abstract": "The human brain has the remarkable capacity to alter in response to environmental demands. Training-induced structural brain changes have been demonstrated in the healthy adult human brain. However, no study has yet directly related structural brain changes to behavioral changes in the developing brain, addressing the question of whether structural brain differences seen in adults (comparing experts with matched controls) are a product of \"nature\" (via biological brain predispositions) or \"nurture\" (via early training). Long-term instrumental music training is an intense, multisensory, and motor experience and offers an ideal opportunity to study structural brain plasticity in the developing brain in correlation with behavioral changes induced by training. Here we demonstrate structural brain changes after only 15 months of musical training in early childhood, which were correlated with improvements in musically relevant motor and auditory skills. These findings shed light on brain plasticity and suggest that structural brain differences in adult experts (whether musicians or experts in other areas) are likely due to training-induced brain plasticity.",

The basic GP system works by\n                 using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of\n                 functions for creating musical sequences, and a user\n                 interface which allows the user to rate individual\n                 sequences. With this user interactive technique it was\n                 possible to generate pleasant tunes over runs of 20\n                 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the\n                 bottleneck in interactive systems, the system takes\n                 rating data from a users run and uses it to train a\n                 neural network based automatic rater, or \u00e4uto\n                 rater\", which can replace the user in bigger runs.\n                 Using this auto rater we were able to make runs of up\n                 to 50 generations with 500 individuals per generation.\n                 The best of run pieces generated by the auto raters\n                 were pleasant but were not, in general, as nice as\n                 those generated in user interactive runs.",

Many of the reported methods, however, have computational requirements that make them impractical for searching realistic collections using current hardware. We compare lightweight measures that appear to perform equally well, and introduce a simplification that reduces memory requirements and execution time by a further order of magnitude. This yields a similarity measure that will scale easily to large commercial collections. We give comparative results over two contrasting music collections, one of which has been widely studied, allowing direct comparison with previous work.",

        "abstract": "Live computer music is the perfect medium for generative music systems, for non-linear compositional constructions and for interactive manipulation of sound processing. Unfortunately, much of the complexity of these real-time systems is lost on a potential audience, excepting those few connoisseurs who sneak round the back to check the laptop screen. An artist using powerful software like SuperCollider or PD cannot be readily distinguished from someone checking their e-mail whilst DJ-ing with iTunes. Without a culture of understanding of both the laptop performer and current generation graphical and text-programming languages for audio, audiences tend to respond most to often gimmicky controllers, or to the tools they have had more exposure to - the (yawn) superstar DJs and their decks. This article attempts to convey the exciting things that are being explored with algorithmic composition and interactive synthesis techniques in live performance. The reasons for building generative music systems and the forms of control attainable over algorithmic processes are investigated. Direct manual control is set against the use of autonomous software agents. In line with this, four techniques for software control during live performance are introduced, namely presets, previewing, autopilot, and the powerful method of live coding. Finally, audio-visual collaboration is discussed.",

Such line segments exist only when chords are nearly symmetrical under translation, reflection, or permutation.

        "abstract": "Music with live electronics involves capturing an acoustic input, converting it to an electrical signal, processing it electronically and converting it back to an acoustic waveform through a loudspeaker. The electronic processing is usually controlled during performance through human interaction with potentiometers, switches, sensors and other tactile controllers. These tan- gible interfaces, when operated by a technical assistant or dedicated elec- tronics performer can be effective for controlling multiple processing pa- rameters. However, when a composer wishes to delegate control over the electronics to an (acoustic) instrumental performer, physical interfaces can sometimes be problematic. Performers who are unfamiliar with electron- ics technology, must learn to operate and interact effectively with the inter- faces provided. The operation of the technology is sometimes unintuitive, and fits uncomfortably with the performer\u2019s learned approach to her instru- ment, creating uncertainty for both performer and audience. The presence of switches or sensors on and around the instrumental performer begs the questions: how should I interact with this and is it working correctly?\r\nIn this thesis I propose an alternative to the physical control paradigm, whereby features derived from the sound produced by the acoustic instru- ment itself are used as a control source. This approach removes the potential for performer anxiety posed by tangible interfaces and allows the performer to focus on instrumental sound production and the effect this has on the electronic processing. A number of experiments will be conducted through a reciprocal process of composition, performance and software develop- ment in order to evaluate a range of methods for instrumental interaction with electronics through sonic change. The focus will be on the use of \u2018low level\u2019 audio features including, but not limited to, fundamental frequency,\r\namplitude, brightness and noise content. To facilitate these experiments, a number of pieces of software for audio feature extraction and visualisa- tion will be developed and tested, the final aim being that this software will be publically released for download and usable in a range of audio feature extraction contexts.\r\nIn the conclusion, I will propose a new approach to working with audio feature extraction in the context of live electronic music. This approach will combine the audio feature extraction and visualisation techniques dis- cussed and evaluated in previous chapters. A new piece of software will be presented in the form of a graphical user interface for perfomers to work interactively using sound as an expressive control source. Conclusions will also be drawn about the methdology employed during this research, with particular focus on the relationship between composition, \u2018do-it-yourself \u2019 live electronics and software development as research process.",

The purpose of the present investigation was\n\tto expand our knowledge on basic auditory abilities of musicians\n\tcompared to non-musicians. Specific goals were: (1) to compare frequency\n\tdiscrimination thresholds (difference limen for frequency DLF)\n\tof non-musical pure tones in controlled groups of professional musicians\n\tand non-musicians; (2) to relate DLF performance to musical background;\n\tand (3) to compare DLF thresholds obtained with two threshold estimation\n\tprocedures: 2- and 3- interval forced choice procedures (2IFC and\n\t3IFC). Subjects were 16 professional musicians and 14 non-musicians.\n\tDLFs were obtained for three frequencies (0.25, 1 and 1.5 kHz) using\n\tthe 3IFC adaptive procedure, and for one frequency (1 kHz) also using\n\tthe 2IFC. Three threshold estimates were obtained for each frequency,\n\tprocedure and subject. The results of the present study support five\n\tmajor findings: (a) mean DLFs for musicians were approximately half\n\tthe values of the non-musicians; (b) significant learning for both\n\tgroups during the three threshold estimations; (c) classical musicians\n\tperformed better than those with contemporary musical background;\n\t(d) performance was influenced by years of musical experience; and\n\t(e) both groups showed better DLF in a 2IFC paradigm compared to\n\tthe 3IFC. These data highlight the importance of short-term training\n\ton an auditory task, auditory memory and factors related to musical\n\tbackground (such as musical genre and years of experience) on auditory\n\tperformance.",

Musicians showed left dominant secondary auditory\n\tareas in the temporal cortex and the left posterior dorsolateral\n\tprefrontal cortex during a passive music listening task, whereas\n\tnon-musicians demonstrated right dominant secondary auditory areas\n\tduring the same task. A significant difference in the degree of activation\n\tbetween musicians and non-musicians was noted in the bilateral planum\n\ttemporale and the left posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\n\tThe degree of activation of the left planum temporale correlated\n\twell with the age at which the person had begun musical training.\n\tFurthermore, the degree of activation in the left posterior dorsolateral\n\tprefrontal cortex and the left planum temporale correlated significantly\n\twith absolute pitch ability. The results indicated distinct neural\n\tactivity in the auditory association areas and the prefrontal cortex\n\tof trained musicians.

Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks for audio-to-score music transcription of monophonic excerpts. Unlike existing music transcription methods, which normally perform pitch estimation, the proposed approach is formulated as an end-to-end task that outputs a notation-level music score. Using an audio file as input, modeled as a sequence of frames, a deep neural network is trained to provide a sequence of music symbols encoding a score, including key and time signatures, barlines, notes (with their pitch spelling and duration) and rests. Our framework is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function trained in an end-to-end fashion, without requiring to align the input frames with the output symbols. A total of 246,870 incipits from the R\u00e9pertoire International des Sources Musicales online catalog were synthesized using different timbres and tempos to build the training data. Alternative input representations (raw audio, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), log-spaced STFT and Constant-Q transform) were evaluated for this task, as well as different output representations (Plaine & Easie Code, Kern, and a purpose-designed output). Results show that it is feasible to directly infer score representations from audio files and most errors come from music notation ambiguities and metering (time signatures and barlines).",

        "abstract": "Previous research has found that enabling users to control the recommendation process increases user satisfaction. However, providing additional controls also increases cognitive load, and different users have different needs for control. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the effect of two personal characteristics: musical sophistication and visual memory capacity. We designed a visual user interface, on top of a commercial music recommender, with different controls: interactions with recommendations (i.e., the output of a recommender system), the user profile (i.e., the top listened songs), and algorithm parameters (i.e., weights in an algorithm). We created eight experimental settings with combinations of these three user controls and conducted a between-subjects study (N=240), to explore the effect on cognitive load and recommendation acceptance for different personal characteristics. We found that controlling recommendations is the most favorable single control element. In addition, controlling user profile and algorithm parameters was the most beneficial setting with multiple controls. Moreover, the participants with high musical sophistication perceived recommendations to be of higher quality, which in turn lead to higher recommendation acceptance. However, we found no effect of visual working memory on either cognitive load or recommendation acceptance. This work contributes an understanding of how to design control that hits the sweet spot between the perceived quality of recommendations and acceptable cognitive load.",

Data streams are stored as single-channel PCM files. The motion-sequence format MJPEG is chosen for video. Annotations are stored as text files. MusicXML is used for musical scores. Data is structured by customizable XML skeleton files enabling meaningful retrieval. Skeleton files are first created during data gathering, and provide means to (re-)organize acquired data in any desired hierarchical structure, as they only hold pointers to stored data files. Once a dataset is created and uploaded to the server, each skeleton file defines a view. Multi-track data visualization is done remotely via a powerful HTML5-based environment that enables web-driven editing (add annotations, extract descriptors) and downloading of datasets. A first instance of RepoVizz has been created within the EU FET-Open Project SIEMPRE, devoted to studying social interaction in ensemble performance.",

Symbolic representations such as MIDI allow the\n\teasy calculation of such information and its manipulation. In contrast,\n\tmost of the existing work in Audio MIR uses timbral and beat information,\n\twhich can be calculated using automatic computer audition techniques.\n\tIn this paper, Pitch Histograms are defined and proposed as a way\n\tto represent the pitch content of music signals both in symbolic\n\tand audio form. This representation is evaluated in the context of\n\tautomatic musical genre classification. A multiple-pitch detection\n\talgorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms\n\tfor audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance\n\tof errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection,\n\tautomatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and\n\taudio data are compared. The comparison indicates that Pitch Histograms\n\tprovide valuable information for musical genre classification. The\n\tresults obtained for both symbolic and audio cases indicate that\n\talthough pitch errors degrade classification performance for the\n\taudio case, Pitch Histograms can be effectively used for classification\n\tin both cases.",

Considering that music mainstream may be defined from different perspectives and on various levels, e.g.,~geographical (charts of a country), genre (``Indie charts\"), or distribution channel (radio charts vs.~download charts), we study how the user's music mainstreaminess influences the quality of music recommendations. The paper's contribution is three-fold.\r\nFirst, we propose 11 novel mainstreaminess measures characterizing music listeners, considering both a global and a country-specific basis. To this end, we model preference profiles (as a vector over artists) for users, countries, and globally, incorporating artist frequency, listener frequency, and a newly proposed TF-IDF-inspired weighting function, which we call artist frequency--inverse listener frequency (AF-ILF). The resulting preference profile for each user $u$ is then related to the respective country-specific and global preference profile using fraction-based approaches, symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kendall's $\\tau$ rank correlation, in order to quantify $u$'s mainstreaminess.\r\nSecond, we demonstrate country-specific peculiarities of these mainstreaminess definitions.\r\nThird, we show that incorporating the proposed global and country-specific mainstreaminess measures into the music recommendation process can notably improve accuracy of rating prediction.",

        "abstract": "While supervised learning has enabled great advances in many areas of music,\r\nlabeled music datasets remain especially hard, expensive and time-consuming to\r\ncreate. In this work, we introduce SimCLR to the music domain and contribute a\r\nlarge chain of audio data augmentations, to form a simple framework for\r\nself-supervised learning of raw waveforms of music: CLMR. This approach\r\nrequires no manual labeling and no preprocessing of music to learn useful\r\nrepresentations. We evaluate CLMR in the downstream task of music\r\nclassification on the MagnaTagATune and Million Song datasets. A linear\r\nclassifier fine-tuned on representations from a pre-trained CLMR model achieves\r\nan average precision of 35.4% on the MagnaTagATune dataset, superseding fully\r\nsupervised models that currently achieve a score of 34.9%. Moreover, we show\r\nthat CLMR's representations are transferable using out-of-domain datasets,\r\nindicating that they capture important musical knowledge. Lastly, we show that\r\nself-supervised pre-training allows us to learn efficiently on smaller labeled\r\ndatasets: we still achieve a score of 33.1% despite using only 259 labeled\r\nsongs during fine-tuning. To foster reproducibility and future research on\r\nself-supervised learning in music, we publicly release the pre-trained models\r\nand the source code of all experiments of this paper on GitHub.",

        "abstract": "Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.",

        "abstract": "Music recommender systems (MRSs) have experienced a boom in recent years, thanks to the emergence and success of online streaming services, which nowadays make available almost all music in the world at the user's fingertip. While today's MRSs considerably help users to find interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond simple user--item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in the field.",

Schutz laid stress on the We-relationship resulting from face-to-face performance of music, in which every listener participates with the other listeners, the performers, and the composers. Becker emphasized the existence of taken-for-granted conventions on which cooperative relations between performers are based, in conjunction with other members of the music subcommunity with whom they are engaged in a communication flow. The involved actors may participate in several reciprocally connected worlds of shared experiences, which if jointly considered constitute the art world. The theoretical and conceptual differences between Schutz and Becker, which concern their sociological writings on music, are related to analogous diversities between Phenomenological Sociology and Symbolic Interactionism. Finally, Weber, Honigsheim, and Adorno\u2019s contributions to the sociology of music have been here considered for comparative purposes.",

However, most approaches are based on the estimation of harmonic and melodic features and neglect lyrics information although it is an important invariant across covers. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging lyrics without requiring access to full texts though the use of lyrics recognition on audio. Our approach relies on the fusion of a singing voice recognition framework and a more classic tonal-based cover detection method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that lyrics estimation from audio has been explicitly used for cover detection. Furthermore, we exploit efficient string matching and an approximated nearest neighbors search algorithm which lead to a scalable system which is able to operate on very large databases. Extensive experiments on the largest publicly available cover detection dataset demonstrate the validity of using lyrics information for this task.",

We propose to distinguish the concept of &quot;performance&quot; from the one of &quot;interpretation&quot;, which expresses the &quot;artistic intention&quot;. Towards assessing this distinction, we carried out an experimental evaluation where subjects were invited to listen to various audio recordings created by resynthesizing MIDI data obtained through Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) systems and a sensorized acoustic piano. During the resynthesis, we simulated different contexts and asked listeners to evaluate how much the interpretation changes when the context changes. Results show that: (1) MIDI format alone is not able to completely grasp the artistic intention of a music performance; (2) usual objective evaluation measures based on MIDI data present low correlations with the average subjective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel measure which is meaningfully correlated with the outcome of the tests. In addition, we investigate multimodal machine learning by providing a new score-informed AMT method and propose an approximation algorithm for the p-dispersion problem.",

Instead of traditional communication media, music is used to inform users about the presence and mood of multiple remote peers. Based on this conceptual idea, an awareness system called 'Social Radio' was developed. The system consists of several smart artifacts and an underlying multi-user communication infrastructure.",

In this paper we identify some of the problems peculiar to musical scores, and propose an approach which succeeds in a wide range of non-trivial cases. The composer customarily proceeds by writing notes, then stems, beams, ties and slurs-we have inverted this approach by segmenting and then subsegmenting scores to recapture the component parts of symbols. In this paper, we concentrate on the strategy of recognizing sub-segmented primitives, and the reassembly process which reconstructs low level graphical primitives back to musical symbols. The sub-segmentation process proves to be worthwhile, since many primitives complement each other and high level musical theory can be employed to enhance the recognition process (12 Refs.)",

The main\n\tgoal is to analyse whether there is any agreement between a group\n\tof experts and a community, when defining a set of genres and their\n\trelationships. For this purpose, three different experiments are\n\tconducted using two datasets: the MP3.com expert taxonomy, and last.fm\n\ttags at artist level. The experimental results show a clear agreement\n\tfor some components of the taxonomy (Blues, Hip-Hop), whilst in other\n\tcases (e.g. Rock) there is no correlations. Interestingly enough,\n\tthe same results are found in the MIREX2007 results for audio genre\n\tclassification task. Therefore, a multi\u2013faceted approach for musical\n\tgenre using expert based classifications, dynamic associations derived\n\tfrom the wisdom of crowds, and content\u2013based analysis can improve\n\tgenre classification, as well as other relevant MIR tasks such as\n\tmusic similarity or music recommendation.",

However, this is by no means a trivial task. A recent trend has been to tackle this challenge using sociocultural connotations rather than the traditional content-based audio or lyrics analysis. This article describes an enhancement to this approach that relies on the acquisition, filtering and condensing of unstructured, text-based information that can be found on the World Wide Web to recognize what the music community regards as ``similar'' artists. The beauty of this approach lies in its ability to access so-called ``cultural metadata'' (i.e., textual data about musical content) which is the aggregation of several independent - originally subjective - perspectives about a piece of music. The major focus of this work is the evaluation and enhancement of existing approaches in this area using filtering methods to increase their precision. A meaningful evaluation of the results is provided by a comparison with ground truth data.",

This process improves \nupon statistical methods of rank reduction as it aims to model a community's reaction \nto perception instead of relationships found in the signal alone. We show increased \naccuracy of common music retrieval tasks with audio projected through semantic ba- \nsis functions. We also evaluate our models in a 'query-by-description' task for music, \nwhere we predict description and community interpretation of audio.

The research area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) covers many of these aspects. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of this vast and new field. A number of issues, which are peculiar to the music language, are described--including forms, formats, and dimensions of music--together with the typologies of users and their information needs. To fulfil these needs a number of approaches are discussed, from direct search to information filtering and clustering of music documents. An overview of the techniques for music processing, which are commonly exploited in many approaches, is also presented. Evaluation and comparisons of the approaches on a common benchmark are other important issues. To this end, a description of the initial efforts and evaluation campaigns for MIR is provided.",

The system\r\nis represented by a bipartite network, nodes being the music groups and the\r\nlisteners. Music groups audience size behaves like a power law, but the\r\nindividual music library size is an exponential with deviations at small\r\nvalues. In order to extract structures from the network, we focus on\r\ncorrelation matrices, that we filter by removing the least correlated links.\r\nThis percolation idea-based method reveals the emergence of social communities\r\nand music genres, that are visualised by a branching representation. Evidence\r\nof collective listening habits that do not fit the neat usual genres defined by\r\nthe music industry indicates an alternative way of classifying listeners/music\r\ngroups. The structure of the network is also studied by a more refined method,\r\nbased upon a random walk exploration of its properties. Finally, a personal\r\nidentification - community imitation model (PICI) for growing bipartite\r\nnetworks is outlined, following Potts ingredients. Simulation results do\r\nreproduce quite well the empirical data.",

One musical statement that attracted much notice was Paul Hindemith's 1921 burlesque opera \"Das Nusch-Nuschi.\" It was based on a Burmese marionette play that scandalously satirized Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde.\" Hindemith's opera resonates strongly with a position then being voiced by Paul Bekker, who spoke out against Hans Pfitzner's Wagnerian hypernationalism and called for a decisive internationalist turn in postwar German composition. It sharpens its ironic, anti-Wangerian tone by reaching beyond German modernism to embrace the Russian \"neonationalism\" of Igor Stravinsky.",

In this work we introduce the Similarity Ontology for describing associations between items. Using a combination of RDF/OWL and N3, our ontology allows for transparency and provenance tracking in a distributed and open system. We describe a similarity ecosystem where agents assert and aggregate similarity statements on the Web of Data allowing a client application to make queries for recommendation, playlisting, or other tasks. In this ecosystem any number of similarity derivation methods can exist side-by-side, specifying similarity relationships as well as the processes used to derive these statements. The data consumer can then select which similarity statements to trust based on knowledge of the similarity derivation processes or a list of trusted assertion agents.",

        "abstract": "The ability to anticipate forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400\u2013450\u00a0ms), (ii) beta band (14\u201330\u00a0Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.",

(5) Which aspects of these resources are specific to music,\n\tand which are more general? We examine these issues by looking at\n\tthe major components of musical organization: rhythm (an interaction\n\tof grouping and meter), tonal organization (the structure of melody\n\tand harmony), and affect (the interaction of music with emotion).\n\tEach domain reveals a combination of cognitively general phenomena,\n\tsuch as gestalt grouping principles, harmonic roughness, and stream\n\tsegregation, with phenomena that appear special to music and language,\n\tsuch as metrical organization. These are subtly interwoven with a\n\tresidue of components that are devoted specifically to music, such\n\tas the structure of tonal systems and the contours of melodic tension\n\tand relaxation that depend on tonality. In the domain of affect,\n\tthese components are especially tangled, involving the interaction\n\tof such varied factors as general-purpose aesthetic framing, communication\n\tof affect by tone of voice, and the musically specific way that tonal\n\tpitch contours evoke patterns of posture and gesture.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of musical training on speech-in-noise\n\t(SIN) performance, a complex task requiring the integration of working\n\tmemory and stream segregation as well as the detection of time-varying\n\tperceptual cues. Previous research has indicated that, in combination\n\twith lifelong experience with musical stream segregation, musicians\n\thave better auditory perceptual skills and working memory. It was\n\thypothesized that musicians would benefit from these factors and\n\tperform better on speech perception in noise than age-matched nonmusician\n\tcontrols. DESIGN: The performance of 16 musicians and 15 nonmusicians\n\twas compared on clinical measures of speech perception in noise-QuickSIN\n\tand Hearing-In-Noise Test (HINT). Working memory capacity and frequency\n\tdiscrimination were also assessed. All participants had normal hearing\n\tand were between the ages of 19 and 31 yr. To be categorized as a\n\tmusician, participants needed to have started musical training before\n\tthe age of 7 yr, have 10 or more years of consistent musical experience,\n\tand have practiced more than three times weekly within the 3 yr before\n\tstudy enrollment. Nonmusicians were categorized by the failure to\n\tmeet the musician criteria, along with not having received musical\n\ttraining within the 7 yr before the study. RESULTS: Musicians outperformed\n\tthe nonmusicians on both QuickSIN and HINT, in addition to having\n\tmore fine-grained frequency discrimination and better working memory.\n\tYears of consistent musical practice correlated positively with QuickSIN,\n\tworking memory, and frequency discrimination but not HINT. The results\n\talso indicate that working memory and frequency discrimination are\n\tmore important for QuickSIN than for HINT. CONCLUSIONS: Musical experience\n\tappears to enhance the ability to hear speech in challenging listening\n\tenvironments. Large group differences were found for QuickSIN, and\n\tthe results also suggest that this enhancement is derived in part\n\tfrom musicians' enhanced working memory and frequency discrimination.\n\tFor HINT, in which performance was not linked to frequency discrimination\n\tability and was only moderately linked to working memory, musicians\n\tstill performed significantly better than the nonmusicians. The group\n\tdifferences for HINT were evident in the most difficult condition\n\tin which the speech and noise were presented from the same location\n\tand not spatially segregated. Understanding which cognitive and psychoacoustic\n\tfactors as well as which lifelong experiences contribute to SIN may\n\tlead to more effective remediation programs for clinical populations\n\tfor whom SIN poses a particular perceptual challenge. These results\n\tprovide further evidence for musical training transferring to nonmusical\n\tdomains and highlight the importance of taking musical training into\n\tconsideration when evaluating a person's SIN ability in a clinical\n\tsetting.",

Moreover, the greatest differences in the ERPs of musician\n\tand nonmusician children were also found for the weak incongruity:\n\twhereas for musician children, early negative components developed\n\tin music and late positive components in language, no such components\n\twere found for nonmusician children. Finally, comparison of these\n\tresults with previous ones from adults suggests that some aspects\n\tof pitch processing are in effect earlier in music than in language.\n\tThus, the present results reveal positive transfer effects between\n\tcognitive domains and shed light on the time course and neural basis\n\tof the development of prosodic and melodic processing.",

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants\n\tfrom a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants,\n\twith both groups being naive to the music of the other respective\n\tculture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three\n\tbasic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western\n\tmusic. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful\n\tWestern music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression\n\tof these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally.\n\tExperiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic\n\tmusic affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well\n\tas in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other\n\tfactors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that\n\tboth groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa\n\tmusic over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that\n\tthe sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was\n\tat least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance\n\tand permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived\n\tpleasantness of music.",

        "abstract": "This study compared the influence of musical and psychoacoustical\n\ttraining on auditory pitch discrimination abilities. In a first experiment,\n\tpitch discrimination thresholds for pure and complex tones were measured\n\tin 30 classical musicians and 30 non-musicians, none of whom had\n\tprior psychoacoustical training. The non-musicians' mean thresholds\n\twere more than six times larger than those of the classical musicians\n\tinitially, and still about four times larger after 2h of training\n\tusing an adaptive two-interval forced-choice procedure; this difference\n\tis two to three times larger than suggested by previous studies.\n\tThe musicians' thresholds were close to those measured in earlier\n\tpsychoacoustical studies using highly trained listeners, and showed\n\tlittle improvement with training; this suggests that classical musical\n\ttraining can lead to optimal or nearly optimal pitch discrimination\n\tperformance. A second experiment was performed to determine how much\n\tadditional training was required for the non-musicians to obtain\n\tthresholds as low as those of the classical musicians from experiment\n\t1. Eight new non-musicians with no prior training practiced the frequency\n\tdiscrimination task for a total of 14 h. It took between 4 and 8h\n\tof training for their thresholds to become as small as those measured\n\tin the classical musicians from experiment 1. These findings supplement\n\tand qualify earlier data in the literature regarding the respective\n\tinfluence of musical and psychoacoustical training on pitch discrimination\n\tperformance.",

        "abstract": "From the seventeenth century to the present day, tonal harmonic music has had a number of invariant properties: specific chord progressions (cadences) that induce a sense of closure; the asymmetrical privileging of certain progressions; the degree of fit between pairs of successively played tones or chords; the privileging of tertial harmony and the major and minor scales.\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation (e.g., Bharucha (1987), Krumhansl (1990), Lerdahl (2001)) has been that this is due to a process of enculturation: frequently occurring musical patterns are learned by listeners, some of whom become composers and replicate the same patterns, which go on to influence the next ``generation'' of composers, and so on. Some contemporary researchers (e.g., Parncutt, Milne (2009), Large (in press)) have argued that these are circular arguments, and have proposed various psychoacoustic, or neural, processes and constraints that shape tonal harmonic music into the form it has actually taken.\n\nIn this presentation, I discuss some of the broader music theoretical implications of my recently developed psychoacoustic model of harmonic cadences (which has had encouraging experimental support (Milne, 2009)). The core of the model is two different psychoacoustically-derived measures of pitch-based distance between chords (one modelling ``fit'', the other ``voice-leading distance''), and the interaction of these two distances to model the feelings of activity, expectation, and resolution induced by certain chord progressions (notably cadences). When a played pair of chords have a poorer fit than an un-played comparison pair, that is also voice-leading-close, it is reasonable to assume the played pair is heard as an alteration of the comparison pair. This is similar to how a harmonically dissonant interval (e.g., the tritone B-F) is likely to be heard as an alteration of a voice-leading-close consonant interval (e.g., the perfect fourth B-E, or the major third C-E).\n\nI explore the extent to which the model can predict the familiar tonal cadences described in music theory (including those containing tritone substitutions), and the asymmetries that are so characteristic of tonal harmony. I also compare and contrast the model with Riemann's functional theory, and show how it may be able to shed light upon the privileged status of the major and minor scales (over the modes), and the dependence of tonality upon triadic harmony.",

The author, one of the 20th century's most prominent figures in music theory, pushes the boundaries of the study of pitch-structure beyond its conception as a static system for classifying and inter-relating chords and sets. Known by most music theorists as &#8220;GMIT&#8221;, the book is by far the most significant contribution to the field of systematic music theory in the last half-century, generating the framework for the &#8220;transformational theory&#8221; movement. Appearing almost twenty years after GMIT's initial publication, this Oxford University Press edition features a previously unpublished preface by the author, as well as a foreword by Edward Gollin contextualizing the work's significance for the current field of music theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers three conceptions of musical distance (or inverse similarity ) that produce three different musico-geometrical spaces: the first, based on voice leading, yields a collection of continuous quotient spaces or orbifolds; the second, based on acoustics, gives rise to the Tonnetz and related tuning lattices ; while the third, based on the total interval content of a group of notes, generates a six-dimensional quality space first described by Ian Quinn. I will show that although these three measures are in principle quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This produces the challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given music-theoretical circumstance. Since the different models can yield comparable results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).",

The author, one of the 20th century's most prominent figures in music theory, pushes the boundaries of the study of pitch-structure beyond its conception as a static system for classifying and inter-relating chords and sets. Known by most music theorists as &#8220;GMIT&#8221;, the book is by far the most significant contribution to the field of systematic music theory in the last half-century, generating the framework for the &#8220;transformational theory&#8221; movement.

This article catalogues and analyzes the frequencies with which weather is depicted in a sample of classical orchestral music. The depictions vary from explicit mimicry using traditional and specialized orchestral instruments, through to subtle suggestions. It is found that composers are generally influenced by their own environment in the type of weather they choose to represent. As befits the national stereotype, British composers seem disproportionately keen to depict the UK's variable weather patterns and stormy coastline.

        "abstract": "In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately 17\u2009000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic 'revolutions' around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.",

        "abstract": "Most of the time when we listen to music on the radio or on our portable devices, the order in which the tracks are played is governed by so-called playlists. These playlists are basically sequences of tracks that traditionally are designed manually and whose organization is based on some underlying logic or theme. With the digitalization of music and the availability of various types of additional track-related information on the Web, new opportunities have emerged on how to automate the playlist creation process. Correspondingly, a number of proposals for automated playlist generation have been made in the literature during the past decade. These approaches vary both with respect to which kind of data they rely on and which types of algorithms they use. In this article, we review the literature on automated playlist generation and categorize the existing approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation designs that are used today in research to assess the quality of the generated playlists. Finally, we report the results of a comparative evaluation of typical playlist generation schemes based on historical data. Our results show that track and artist popularity can play a dominant role and that additional measures are required to better characterize and compare the quality of automatically generated playlists.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhile the Optical Music Recognition (OMR) of printed and handwritten music scores in modern standard notation has been broadly studied, this is not the case for early music manuscripts. This is mainly due to the high variability in the sources introduced by their severe physical degradation, the lack of notation standards and, in the case of the scanned versions, by non-homogenous image-acquisition protocols. The volume of early musical manuscripts available is considerable, and therefore we believe that computational methods can be extremely useful in helping to preserve, share and analyse this information. This paper presents an approach to recognizing handwritten square musical notation in degraded western plainchant manuscripts from the XIVth to XVIth centuries. We propose the use of image processing techniques that behave robustly under high data variability and which do not require strong hypotheses regarding the condition of the sources. The main differences from traditional OMR approaches are our avoidance of the staff line removal stage and the use of grey-level images to perform primitive segmentation and feature extraction. We used 136 images from the Digital Scriptorium repository (DS, 2007), from which we were able to extract over 90\\% of the staves and over 88\\% of all symbols present. For symbol classification, we used gradient-based features and SVM classifiers, obtaining over 90\\% precision and recall over eight basic symbol classes.",

Furthermore, we analyze the effect of two improvements of the representation: a Bhattacharyya embedding, which improves the results at virtually no extra cost, and a Fisher Vector representation that very significantly improves the results at the cost of a more complex and costly representation. Experimental evaluation shows results more than 20 points above the state-of-the-art in a new, challenging dataset.",

In this paper we introduce a symbol-dependent approach for identifying the writer of old music scores, which is based on two symbol recognition methods. The main idea is to use the Blurred Shape Model descriptor and a DTW-based method for detecting, recognizing and describing the music clefs and notes. The proposed approach has been evaluated in a database of old music scores, achieving very high writer identification rates.",

        "abstract": "Automated symbolic music alignment is a challenging task due to the variation of performance by different performers. It becomes more complicated when dealing with polyphonic music because note events could occur at the same time. The goal of this study is to find an efficient algorithm for aligning two polyphonic symbolic representations (MIDI files, for instance) of the same music. To this end, we design two methods for such score-performance alignment that matches the performance with its corresponding score. The first method applies a string matching algorithm based on dynamic programming. The second method is based on the principle of \"divide and conquer\" that performs efficient alignment recursively. To evaluate the algorithms, we have collected a set of 21 MIDI pairs of classic piano performance with human corrected note-level mapping as ground truth. We have released the dataset as a public resource. Both the proposed algorithms achieved a precision and recall higher than 96% in our experiment, outperforming the most recently proposed method 7 in the literature. Besides, the execution time of proposed methods is much faster the method of 7.",

With the ever-growing interest from the general public towards understanding climate science, it is becoming increasingly important that we present this information in ways accessible to non-experts.</p> <p> In this pilot study, we use time series data from the first United Kingdom Earth System model (UKESM1) to create six procedurally generated musical pieces and use them to test whether we can use music to engage with the wider community. Each of these pieces is based around a unique part of UKESM1's ocean component model, either in terms of a scientific principle or a practical aspect of modelling. In addition, each piece is arranged using a different musical progression, style and tempo.</p> <p>These pieces were performed by the digital piano synthesizer, TiMidity++, and were published on the lead author's YouTube channel. The videos all show the time progression of the data in time with the music and a brief description of the methodology is posted below the video. To disseminate these works, a link to each piece was published on the lead authors personal and professional social media accounts.</p> <p>The reach of these works was analysed using YouTube's channel monitoring toolkit for content creators, YouTube studio. In the first ninety days after the first video was published, the six pieces reached at least 251 unique viewers, and have 553 total views. We found that most of the views occurred in the fourteen days immediately after each video was published. In effect, once the concept had been demonstrated to an audience, there was reduced enthusiasm from that audience to return to it immediately. This suggests that to use music effectively as an science outreach tool, the works needs to reach new audiences or new and unique content needs to be delivered to a returning audience.</p>",

The authors argue that research on creative industries also requires consideration of the role of place in the experience of employment insecurity and career commitment. This article focuses on self-employed musicians in the mid-sized city of St John\u2019s, Canada. Interviews with 54 musicians draw attention to coping strategies for long periods of low pay and employment insecurity. These strategies include downplaying competition and conflict, acquiring higher education and changing career. It is argued that population size and location of the community where work is based have implications on such coping strategies and on career longevity.",

Focusing on the specifities of music preferences, we study user connections on Last.fm\u2014an online social network for music. We identify those countries whose users are mainly connected within the same country, and those countries that are characterized by cross-country user connections. Strong cross-country connection pairs are typically characterized by similar cultural, historic, or linguistic backgrounds, or geographic proximity. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia are identified as countries having a large relative amount of user connections from other countries. Our results contribute to understanding the complexity of social ties and how they are reflected in connection behavior, and are a promising source for advancements of personalized systems.",

        "abstract": "In musicology and music research generally, the increasing availability\n\tof digital music, storage capacities, and computing power enable\n\tand require new and intelligent systems. In the transition from traditional\n\tto digital musicology, many techniques and tools have been developed\n\tfor the analysis of individual pieces of music, but large-scale music\n\tdata that are increasingly becoming available require research methods\n\tand systems that work on the collection-level and at scale. Although\n\tmany relevant algorithms have been developed during the past 15 years\n\tof research in Music Information Retrieval, an integrated system\n\tthat supports large-scale digital musicology research has so far\n\tbeen lacking. In the Digital Music Lab (DML) project, a collaboration\n\tamong music librarians, musicologists, computer scientists, and human-computer\n\tinterface specialists, the DML software system has been developed\n\tthat fills this gap by providing intelligent large-scale music analysis\n\twith a user-friendly interactive interface supporting musicologists\n\tin their exploration and enquiry. The DML system empowers musicologists\n\tby addressing several challenges: distributed processing of audio\n\tand other music data, management of the data analysis process and\n\tresults, remote analysis of data under copyright, logical inference\n\ton the extracted information and metadata, and visual web-based interfaces\n\tfor exploring and querying the music collections. The DML system\n\tis scalable and based on Semantic Web technology and integrates into\n\tLinked Data with the vision of a distributed system that enables\n\tmusic research across archives, libraries, and other providers of\n\tmusic data. A first DML system prototype has been set up in collaboration\n\twith the British Library and I Like Music Ltd. This system has been\n\tused to analyse a diverse corpus of currently 250,000 music tracks.\n\tIn this article, we describe the DML system requirements, design,\n\tarchitecture, components, and available data sources, explaining\n\ttheir interaction. We report use cases and applications with initial\n\tevaluations of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "A large corpus of music written in lute tablature, spanning some three-and-a-half\n\tcenturies, has survived. This music has so far escaped systematic\n\tmusicological research because of its notational format. Being a\n\tpractical instruction for the player, tablature reveals very little\n\tof the polyphonic structure of the music it encodes--and is therefore\n\trelatively inaccessible to non-specialists. Automatic polyphonic\n\ttranscription into modern music notation can help unlock the corpus\n\tto a larger audience, and thus facilitate musicological research.\n\tIn this study we present four variants of a machinelearning model\n\tfor voice separation and duration reconstruction in 16th-century\n\tlute tablature. These models are intended to form the heart of an\n\tinteractive system for automatic polyphonic transcription that can\n\tassist users in making editions tailored to their own preferences.\n\tAdditionally, such models can provide new methods for analysing different\n\taspects of polyphonic structure. We have experimented with modelling\n\tonly voice and modelling voice and duration simultaneously, applying\n\teach in a forward- and in a backward-processing approach. The models\n\tare evaluated on a dataset containing 15 three- and four-voice intabulations.\n\tEach processing approach has its advantages, and the results vary\n\tbetween the models. With accuracy rates between approximately 80\n\tand 90 per cent, both for voice prediction and for duration prediction,\n\tthe best models' performance is promising. Even in this early stage\n\tof the research, such models yield a useful initial transcription\n\tsystem. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR",

        "abstract": "AbstractCan a computer play a music score, e.g. via a Disklavier,\n\tin a way that cannot be distinguished from a human performance of\n\tthe same music? One hundred and seventy-two participants with a wide\n\trange of music playing backgrounds rated sound recordings of 7 performances\n\tof piano music by Kuhlau, one played by a human, and six generated\n\tby algorithms, including a \u2018mechanical\u2019 and an \u2018unmusical\u2019 rendering.\n\tParticipants rated the extent to which each performance was by a\n\thuman and explained their answers. The mechanical performance had\n\tthe lowest mean rating, but the human performance was rated as statistically\n\tidentical to the other stimuli. There were no differences between\n\tratings made by classical piano experts and lay listeners, but despite\n\tthis, the musicians were more confident with their ratings. Qualitative\n\tanalysis revealed five broad themes that contribute to judging whether\n\ta piece appears to be human. The themes were labelled (in descending\n\torder of frequency) intuitive, expressive, imperfections, halo (global\n\tpreference) and empathy. This paper presents new evidence systematically\n\tdemonstrating that algorithm generated performances of piano music\n\tcan be indistinguishable from human performances, suggesting some\n\tparallels with the 1990s victory of the Deep Blue computer of the\n\tworld champion (human) chess player.",

        "abstract": "Music recommender systems have become an integral part of music streaming services such as Spotify and Last.fm to assist users navigating the extensive music collections offered by them. However, while music listeners interested in mainstream music are traditionally served well by music recommender systems, users interested in music beyond the mainstream (i.e., non-popular music) rarely receive relevant recommendations. In this paper, we study the characteristics of beyond-mainstream music and music listeners and analyze to what extent these characteristics impact the quality of music recommendations provided. Therefore, we create a novel dataset consisting of Last.fm listening histories of several thousand beyond-mainstream music listeners, which we enrich with additional metadata describing music tracks and music listeners. Our analysis of this dataset shows four subgroups within the group of beyond-mainstream music listeners that differ not only with respect to their preferred music but also with their demographic characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality of music recommendations that these subgroups are provided with four different recommendation algorithms where we find significant differences between the groups. Specifically, our results show a positive correlation between a subgroup\u2019s openness towards music listened to by members of other subgroups and recommendation accuracy. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights for developing improved user models and recommendation approaches to better serve beyond-mainstream music listeners.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems are efficient at predicting users\u2019 current preferences, but how users\u2019 preferences develop over time is still under-explored. In this work, we study the development of users\u2019 musical preferences. Exploring musical preference consistency between short-term and long-term preferences in data from earlier studies, we find that users with higher musical expertise have more consistent preferences at their top-listened artists and tags than those with lower musical expertise. Users typically chose to explore genres that were close to their current preferences, and this effect was stronger for expert users. Based on these findings we conducted a user study on genre exploration to investigate (1) whether it is possible to nudge users to explore more distant genres, and (2) how users\u2019 exploration behaviors within a genre are influenced by default recommendation settings that balance personalization with genre representativeness in different ways. Our results show that users were more likely to select the more distant genres if these were presented at the top of the list. However, users with high musical expertise were less likely to do so, consistent with our earlier findings. When given a representative or mixed (balanced) default for exploration within a genre, users selected less personalized recommendation settings and explored further away from their current preferences, than with a personalized default. However, this effect was moderated by users\u2019 slider usage behaviors. Overall, our results suggest that (personalized) defaults can nudge users to explore new, more distant genres and songs. However, the effect is smaller for those with higher musical expertise levels.",

While existing approaches depend on explicit manual annotations and meta-data assigned to the individual audio pieces, we automatically derive descriptions by making use of methods from Web Retrieval and Music Information Retrieval. Based on the ID3 tags of a collection of mp3 files, we retrieve relevant Web pages via Google queries and use the contents of these pages to characterize the music pieces and represent them by term vectors. By incorporating complementary information about acoustic similarity we are able to both reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and improve the performance of retrieval, i.e. the quality of the results. Furthermore, the usage of audio similarity allows us to also characterize audio pieces when there is no associated information found on the Web.",

For more\r\nthan a decade, VI systems suffered from the accuracy-scalability trade-off,\r\nwith attempts to increase accuracy that typically resulted in cumbersome,\r\nnon-scalable systems. Recent years, however, have witnessed the rise of deep\r\nlearning-based approaches that take a step toward bridging the\r\naccuracy-scalability gap, yielding systems that can realistically be deployed\r\nin industrial applications. Although this trend positively influences the\r\nnumber of researchers and institutions working on VI, it may also result in\r\nobscuring the literature before the deep learning era. To appreciate two\r\ndecades of novel ideas in VI research and to facilitate building better\r\nsystems, we now review some of the successful concepts and applications\r\nproposed in the literature and study their evolution throughout the years.",

The approach consists of the extraction of features from a low-quality audio recording and in their resynthesis with digital synthesizers, placing a particular attention on the difference between the original and the synthesizer acoustical contexts. To this end and in line with recent literature, a distinction is proposed between the concept of \"performance\" and the one of \"interpretation\", which expresses the \u00e4rtistic intention\". In the paper, first, the existing DSP techniques for the restoration of deteriorated music sources are reviewed while considering both\r\ntechnical aspects and ethical implications. Then, their limitations are analyzed and the novel automated approach able to address the previous ethical issues is described. Finally, various synthesis methods are examined and possible solutions for the realization of the proposed approach are discussed.",

These\r\npredictions are then concatenated together and used as the input to train\r\nanother model with the pitch labels to obtain the final transcription. We\r\nattempt to use only the pitch labels (together with spectrogram reconstruction\r\nloss) and explore how far this model can go without introducing supervised\r\nsub-tasks. In this paper, we do not aim at achieving state-of-the-art\r\ntranscription accuracy, instead, we explore the effect that spectrogram\r\nreconstruction has on our AMT model. Our proposed model consists of two U-nets:\r\nthe first U-net transcribes the spectrogram into a posteriorgram, and a second\r\nU-net transforms the posteriorgram back into a spectrogram. A reconstruction\r\nloss is applied between the original spectrogram and the reconstructed\r\nspectrogram to constrain the second U-net to focus only on reconstruction. We\r\ntrain our model on three different datasets: MAPS, MAESTRO, and MusicNet. Our\r\nexperiments show that adding the reconstruction loss can generally improve the\r\nnote-level transcription accuracy when compared to the same model without the\r\nreconstruction part. Moreover, it can also boost the frame-level precision to\r\nbe higher than the state-of-the-art models. The feature maps learned by our\r\nU-net contain gridlike structures (not present in the baseline model) which\r\nimplies that with the presence of the reconstruction loss, the model is\r\nprobably trying to count along both the time and frequency axis, resulting in a\r\nhigher note-level transcription accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews the basics of music and room acoustics perception, an overview of auralization methods for the investigation of music performance and a series of studies related to the impact of room acoustics on listeners and musicians. The acoustics of the performance environment play a major role for musicians, both during rehearsals and concerts. However, systematic investigations of music performance are challenging due to the variety of conditions that determine the artists' performance. Set-ups that allow controlled studies with variable but well-defined acoustic conditions have been developed over the last decades with increasing naturalness and applicability. Current auralization methods allow the reproduction of measured or synthesized room acoustics in real-time, thus enabling the perceptual assessment of room acoustics in laboratory conditions, isolating acoustics from other potential impacting factors. Common methodologies, as well as advantages and limitations of such virtual environments for the study of music and room acoustics perception are discussed in the first section. The virtual environments enable studies that help to explain why and how room acoustics can affect the listener subjective impact of a musical performance and to what extent listeners can be classified depending on their individual taste. Recent studies have shown that musicians systematically adjust their musical performance and adapt to the room acoustical conditions. The most important findings from these studies are presented in the second section. Methods and results from recent investigations of the impact of room acoustics on music performance are discussed in the third section of this chapter.",

        "abstract": "Fairness is an important aspect in group recommender systems (GRSs). They must ensure that potentially diverse preferences of all group members are taken into consideration when providing recommendations. Previous work has proposed a number of conflict elicitation and merging techniques to produce preferable recommendations for group members. However, we have yet to understand the influence of user personality on the perception of fairness in GRSs. To examine this gap, we use music recommendation as an example domain. We have developed a web-based group music recommender system using the Spotify API and two simple ranking algorithms: one based on the time the songs were voted by users (time-based) and the other based on a dissimilarity score (dissimilarity-based). A within-subjects experiment was conducted with 45 participants divided into groups of 3 (15 groups). Results showed that openness personality has a negative correlation with the perception that fairness is important in groups.",

        "abstract": "Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.",

The SOM was trained with\n                 music of desired quality and was used as fitness\n                 functions. In this work, we are not interested in music\n                 with complex rules but with simple music employed in\n                 computer games.

        "abstract": "Since the 1980s, \"Re\" has been the predominant cultural mode. This condition is an endless lifestyle loop of repeating, retrieving, rewinding, recycling, reciting, redesigning and reprocessing. Popular music's backward spin accelerated and diversified dramatically during the Re Era. The past quarter century's \"like a version\" loop invites \"The Cover Age\" as a fitting characterization. Standardization, interpretation, incorporation, adaptation, appropriation and appreciation have been manifest in a multitude of musical manners and methods, including retrospectives and reissues, the emergence of rap and sampling as commercially dominant pop styles, karaoke, and a steady flow, if not stream, of cover compilations and tribute recordings which revisit a significant cross section of musical periods, styles, genre and artists and their catalogs of compositions. This essay is a collage and chronicle of the continuous coverage, intertextuality, and issues (imitation, ownership, apprenticeship, and preservation) within the karaoke climate of the music, mass media and marketplace triad, with artists, producers, record companies and consumers cohorts in the massive cover up.

In contrast, this study examines the variety of ways that radio programmers answer this question by conceptualizing them as mediators between record companies and radio audiences. From interviews with programmers at commercial radio stations in the United States we identify key programming practices that programmers use to manage their stations' music formats and present a typology of repertoires of such practices. We then discuss the implications of each programming repertoire for stations' music formats and the structural conditions that promote the use of each programming repertoire. In conclusion, we consider the study's implications for understanding culture production in the commercial radio industry.\r\nER  -",

        "abstract": "Signal processing methods for audio classification and music content analysis are developed in this thesis. Audio classification is here understood as the process of assigning a discrete category label to an unknown recording. Two specific problems of audio classification are considered: musical instrument recognition and context recognition. In the former, the system classifies an audio recording according to the instrument, e.g. violin, flute, piano, that produced the sound. The latter task is about classifying an environment, such a car, restaurant, or library, based on its ambient audio background.\r\n       \r\n       In the field of music content analysis, methods are presented for music meter analysis and chorus detection. Meter analysis methods consider the estimation of the regular pattern of strong and weak beats in a piece of music. The goal of chorus detection is to locate the chorus segment in music which is often the catchiest and most memorable part of a song. These are among the most important and readily commercially applicable content attributes that can be automatically analyzed from music signals.\r\n       \r\n       For audio classification, several features and classification methods are proposed and evaluated. In musical instrument recognition, we consider methods to improve the performance of a baseline audio classification system that uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and their first derivatives as features, and continuous-density hidden Markov models (HMMs) for modeling the feature distributions. Two improvements are proposed to increase the performance of this baseline system. First, transforming the features to a base with maximal statistical independence using independent component analysis. Secondly, discriminative training is shown to further improve the recognition accuracy of the system.\r\n       \r\n       For musical meter analysis, three methods are proposed. The first performs meter analysis jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level, which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. The features obtained from an accent feature analyzer and a bank of combfilter resonators are processed by a novel probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and performs joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses.\r\n       \r\n       The second method focuses on estimating the beat and the tatum. The design goal was to keep the method computationally very efficient while retaining sufficient analysis accuracy. Simplified probabilistic modeling is proposed for beat and tatum period and phase estimation, and ensuring the continuity of the estimates. A novel phase-estimator based on adaptive comb filtering is presented. The accuracy of the method is close to the first method but with a fraction of the computational cost.\r\n       \r\n       The third method for music rhythm analysis focuses on improving the accuracy in music tempo estimation. The method is based on estimating the tempo of periodicity vectors using locally weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression. Regression closely relates to classification, the difference being that the goal of regression is to estimate the value of a continuous variable (the tempo), whereas in classification the value to be assigned is a discrete category label. We propose a resampling step applied to an unknown periodicity vector before finding the nearest neighbors to increase the likelihood of finding a good match from the training set. This step improves the performance of the method significantly. The tempo estimate is computed as a distance-weighted median of the nearest neighbor tempi. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significantly better tempo estimation accuracies than three reference methods.\r\n       \r\n       Finally, we describe a computationally efficient method for detecting a chorus section in popular and rock music. The method utilizes a self-dissimilarity representation that is obtained by summing two separate distance matrices calculated using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient and pitch chroma features. This is followed by the detection of off-diagonal segments of small distance in the distance matrix. From the detected segments, an initial chorus section is selected using a scoring mechanism utilizing several heuristics, and subjected to further processing.",

        "abstract": "From an early age, musicians learn complex motor and auditory skills\n\t(e.g., the translation of visually perceived musical symbols into\n\tmotor commands with simultaneous auditory monitoring of output),\n\twhich they practice extensively from childhood throughout their entire\n\tcareers. Using a voxel-by-voxel morphometric technique, we found\n\tgray matter volume differences in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial\n\tbrain regions when comparing professional musicians (keyboard players)\n\twith a matched group of amateur musicians and non-musicians. Although\n\tsome of these multiregional differences could be attributable to\n\tinnate predisposition, we believe they may represent structural adaptations\n\tin response to long-term skill acquisition and the repetitive rehearsal\n\tof those skills. This hypothesis is supported by the strong association\n\twe found between structural differences, musician status, and practice\n\tintensity, as well as the wealth of supporting animal data showing\n\tstructural changes in response to long-term motor training. However,\n\tonly future experiments can determine the relative contribution of\n\tpredisposition and practice.",

Language\n\tand music cannot be considered single entities; they need to be decomposed\n\tinto different component operations or levels of processing. The\n\tcentral question concerns one of the most important claims of the\n\tgenerative grammar theory, that is, the specificity of language processing:\n\tdo the computations performed to process language rely on specific\n\tlinguistic processes or do they rely on general cognitive principles?\n\tEvidence from brain imaging results is reviewed, noting that this\n\tfield is currently in need of metanalysis of the available results\n\tto precisely evaluate this claim. A series of experiments, mainly\n\tusing the event-related brain potentials method, were conducted to\n\tcompare different levels of processing in language and music. Overall,\n\tresults favor language specificity when certain aspects of semantic\n\tprocessing in language are compared with certain aspects of melodic\n\tand harmonic processing in music. By contrast, results support the\n\tview that general cognitive principles are involved when aspects\n\tof syntactic processing in language are compared with aspects of\n\tharmonic processing in music. Moreover, analysis of the temporal\n\tstructure led to similar effects in language and music. These tentative\n\tconclusions must be supported by other brain imaging results to shed\n\tfurther light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain structure-function\n\trelationship.",

Of specific interest was whether\n\talso musicians with such divergent backgrounds have facilitated accuracy\n\tin automatic and/or attentive levels of auditory processing. Thirteen\n\tprofessional musicians and 13 nonmusicians were presented with frequent\n\tstandard sounds and rare deviant sounds (0.8, 2, or 4\\% higher in\n\tfrequency). Auditory event-related potentials evoked by these sounds\n\twere recorded while first the subjects read a self-chosen book and\n\tsecond they indicated behaviorally the detection of sounds with deviant\n\tfrequency. Musicians detected the pitch changes faster and more accurately\n\tthan nonmusicians. The N2b and P3 responses recorded during attentive\n\tlistening had larger amplitude in musicians than in nonmusicians.\n\tInterestingly, the superiority in pitch discrimination accuracy in\n\tmusicians over nonmusicians was observed not only with the 0.8\\%\n\tbut also with the 2\\% frequency changes. Moreover, also nonmusicians\n\tdetected quite reliably the smallest pitch changes of 0.8\\%. However,\n\tthe mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a recorded during a reading condition\n\tdid not differentiate musicians and nonmusicians.

Three\n\tdifferent subject groups were investigated to examine developmental\n\taspects and effects of musical training: 10-year-old children with\n\tvarying degrees of musical training, adults without formal musical\n\ttraining (nonmusicians), and adult musicians.

In music, the upper note is typically carried\n\tby the upper voice, and the enhancement of the upper tone likely\n\treflects musicians' extensive experience attending to the upper voice.\n\tNeural phase locking to the temporal periodicity of the amplitude-modulated\n\tenvelope, which underlies the perception of musical harmony, was\n\talso more precise in musicians than nonmusicians.

First, to illustrate how recently developed technologies are giving rise to new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between music and place. Applying the concept of mythscapes, developed from Appadurai's work, to the 'Canterbury Sound', a term recently revived and adapted by a website-centred fanbase to describe a loosely defined back-catalogue of albums, songs and home-recorded musical experiments, the article argues that the city of Canterbury is being inscribed with a series of urban myths relating to its perceived role in the creation of a musical style deemed by fans to be locally specific. Second, through its analysis of the Canterbury Sound's 'construction' on the Internet, the article considers the extent to which the Canterbury Sound can be considered a 'virtual' scene, Internet communication replacing more conventional forms of celebrating collective musical taste as these emerge through the sociality of club, concert hall and festival-based scenes.",

        "abstract": "Music appears to deeply affect emotional, cerebral and physiological states.Yet, the relationship between specific musical parameters and emotional responses is still not clear. Even if it is difficult to expect reproducible and independent control of musical parameters from human performers, synthetic music systems now allow to generate expressive musical pieces. In this study, we use a system, called the SMuSe, to generate a set of well-controlled musical stimuli, and analyze the influence of parameters of musical structure, performance and timbre on emotional responses.\n\n13 students (5 women, M: 25.8 , range: 22-31) took part in the experiment. They were asked to rate three blocks of sound samples in terms of the emotion they felt on a 5 points SAM scale of valence, arousal and dominance. These blocks corresponded to changes in the structure parameter: 3 modes (Minor, Major, Random ) * 3 registers (Bass, Tenor, Soprano); performance level: 3 tempi (Lento, Moderato, Presto) * 3 dynamics (Piano, Mezzo Forte, Forte) * 3 articulations (Staccato, Regular, Legato); and timbre: 3 Attack time (Short, Medium, Long) * 3 Brightness (Dull, Regular, Bright) * 3 Damping (Low, Medium, High). For each block, we followed a repeated measure design where the conditions were presented in random order.\n\nRepeated measure MANOVAs showed that minor and random modes were more negative, while soprano register was more arousing. Staccato articulations, presto tempi and forte dynamics felt more arousing but also more negative. Presto tempi and forte dynamics were perceived as more dominant. Bright sounds with short-attack and low damping were more arousing. Longer attacks and brighter sounds felt more negative. Finally, bright and low damping sounds were perceived as more dominant.\n\nThis study shows the potential of synthetic music systems for analyzing and inducing musical emotion. In the future, such systems will be highly relevant for therapeutic applications but also for sound-based diagnosis, interactive gaming, and physiologically-based musical instruments.",

        "abstract": "Computer applications are an everyday tool for music analysts, composers, and music theory students. While these applications are a welcome tool to be used in the classrooms and research labs, their effectiveness could be improved by focusing on their usability. The usability of a user interface can be evaluated and even measured with respect to the goals of its users. In order to demonstrate the evaluation of a user interface, I present an experiment in which the efficiency of user interfaces is assessed in the context of three scenarios or ``use cases.'' Based on the experiment, I discuss some basic principles of usability theory, such as affordances, minimization of navigation, error handling, immediate feedback, and data visibility. The evaluation of these principles suggests some new types of music theory applications.",

        "abstract": "The Topos of Music is the upgraded and vastly deepened English extension of the seminal German Geometrie der Tone. It reflects the dramatic progress of mathematical music theory and its operationalization by information technology since the publication of Geometrie der Tone in 1990. The conceptual basis has been vastly generalized to topos-theoretic foundations, including a corresponding thoroughly geometric musical logic. The theoretical models and results now include topologies for rhythm, melody, and harmony, as well as a classification theory of musical objects that comprises the topos-theoretic concept framework. Classification also implies techniques of algebraic moduli theory. The classical models of modulation and counterpoint have been extended to exotic scales and counterpoint interval dichotomies. The probably most exciting new field of research deals with musical performance and its implementation on advanced object-oriented software environments. This subject not only uses extensively the existing mathematical music theory, it also opens the language to differential equations and tools of differential geometry, such as Lie derivatives. Mathematical performance theory is the key to inverse performance theory, an advanced new research field which deals with the calculation of varieties of parameters which give rise to a determined performance. This field uses techniques of algebraic geometry and statistics, approaches which have already produced significant results in the understanding of highest-ranked human performances. The book's formal language and models are currently being used by leading researchers in Europe and Northern America and have become a foundation of music software design. This is also testified by the book's nineteen collaborators and the included CD-ROM containing software and music examples.",

Well-formedness is defined in terms of a relationship between the order in which a single interval generates the elements of a pitch-class set and the order in which those elements appear in a scale. Another characterization provides a recursive procedure for organizing all well-formed scales into hierarchies. Finally, well-formed scales are defined in terms of scale-step measure, and aspects of the diatonic set are examined.",

Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and it is challenging to study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world usage log data gathered from Bugs Music, which is one of the well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users' music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider temporal context in their recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Low-load coordination dynamics were measured in athletes, physiotherapists, gymnasts, musicians and patients after stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord lesion during exercise on a special coordination dynamic therapy device to quantify differences in central nervous system (CNS) organization between healthy subjects and patients with CNS injury. In healthy humans coordination dynamics (arrhythmicity of turning) varied between 5.2 and 6.0 for forward and between 6.9 and 10.7 1/s for backward turning. The frequency of turning varied between 1.24 (athletes) and 1.49 Hz (musicians) for forward and between 1.11 and 1.25 Hz for backward turning. Apart from the poor rhythmicity of backward turning among physiotherapists, gymnasts and musicians, inter-group differences were small in comparison to intra-group variation. In patients with spinal cord lesion the coordination dynamics value was 8.3 for forward and 11.0 for backward turning. The frequencies for forward and backward turning were 1.20 and 1.20 Hz respectively. The values for coordination dynamics and frequency of turning thus did only slightly differ from those measured for healthy subjects. The patients after stroke, traumatic brain injury and cerebral palsy had much higher coordination dynamic values (20.4, 22.9 and 30 1/s respectively) and lower forward (0.85, 0.93, and 0.52 Hz) and backward turning frequencies (0.98, 1.06, 0.42 Hz), suggesting strongly pathologic CNS organization. Low-load coordination dynamics (20N) are thus useful to measure progress in CNS organization due to therapy in patients with CNS injury.",

Our dynamic relationship with a meaningful environment and the structured auditory information that it produces is shown to provide the grounds for developing compositional techniques and tools that exploit a closer relationship to sounds through their direct perceptual links to causal actions and events. These links are also shown to provide the basis for a common ground between composer and listener that redefines the acousmatic by reinstating and reassessing the importance of mimesis in electroacoustic music.",

Based on the LFM-1b dataset (including 53,258 users from 47 countries), we show that there are significant country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption behavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to. Results indicate that, for instance, Finnish users' listening behavior is farther away from the global mainstream, while United States' listeners are close to the global mainstream. Relying on rating prediction experiments, we tailor recommendations to a user's level of preference for mainstream (defined on a global level and on a country level) and the user's country. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction accuracy, a combination of these two filtering strategies works particularly well for users of countries far away from the global mainstream.",

In order to fill this gap, we conducted a large-scale user survey questioning various aspects of people's music information needs and behaviors. In particular, we investigated if general music users' needs and behaviors have significantly changed over time by comparing our current survey results with a similar survey conducted in 2004. In this paper, we present the key findings from the survey data and discuss 4 emergent themes-(a) the shift in access and use of personal music collections; (b) the growing need for tools to support collaborative music seeking, listening, and sharing; (c) the importance of 'visual' music experiences; and (d) the need for ontologies for providing rich contextual information. We conclude by making specific recommendations for improving the design of MIR systems and services.",

In complex situations,\r\nwhere not all intervals of a chord can be tuned according to just frequency\r\nratios, the method automatically yields a tempered compromise.

The model is based on generative learning paradigms of machine learning and deep learning, such as recurrent neural networks. Related works consider music as a text of a natural language, requiring the network to learn the syntax of the sheet music completely and the dependencies among symbols. This involves a very intense training and may produce overfitting in many cases. This paper contributes with a data preprocessing that eliminates the most complex dependencies allowing the musical content to be abstracted from the syntax. Moreover, a web application based on the trained models is presented. The tool allows inexperienced users to generate automatic music from scratch or from a given fragment of sheet music.",

        "abstract": "Automatic music-understanding technologies (automatic analysis of\n\tmusic signals) make possible the creation of intelligent music interfaces\n\tthat enrich music experiences and open up new ways of listening to\n\tmusic. In the past, it was common to listen to music in a somewhat\n\tpassive manner; in the future, people will be able to enjoy music\n\tin a more active manner by using music technologies. Listening to\n\tmusic through active interactions is called active music listening.\n\tIn this keynote speech I first introduce active music listening interfaces\n\tdemonstrating how end users can benefit from music-understanding\n\ttechnologies based on signal processing and/or machine learning.\n\tBy analyzing the music structure (chorus sections), for example,\n\tthe SmartMusicKIOSK interface enables people to access their favorite\n\tpart of a song directly (skipping other parts) while viewing a visual\n\trepresentation of the song's structure. I then introduce our recent\n\tchallenge of deploying such research-level music interfaces as web\n\tservices open to the public. Those services augment people's understanding\n\tof music, enable music-synchronized control of computer-graphics\n\tanimation and robots, and provide various bird's-eye views on a large\n\tmusic collection. In the future, further advances in music-understanding\n\ttechnologies and music interfaces based on them will make interaction\n\tbetween people and music even more active and enriching.",

In\n\tthe context of large musical databases and Electronic Music Distribution,\n\tgenre is therefore a crucial metadata for the description of music\n\tcontent. However, genre is intrinsi- cally ill-defined and attempts\n\tat defining genre precisely have a strong tendency to end up in circular,\n\tungrounded projec- tions of fantasies. Is genre an intrinsic attribute\n\tof music titles, as, say, tempo? Or is genre a extrinsic description\n\tof the whole piece? In this article, we discuss the various approaches\n\tin representing musical genre, and propose to classify these approaches\n\tin three main categories: manual, prescriptive and emergent approaches.\n\tWe discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and illustrate our\n\tstudy with results of the Cuidado IST project.",

We introduce an alternative normalization paradigm, MUSiCC, which combines universal single-copy genes with machine learning methods to correct these biases and to obtain an accurate and biologically meaningful measure of gene abundances. Finally, we demonstrate that MUSiCC significantly improves downstream discovery of functional shifts in the microbiome.MUSiCC is available at http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/software.html .",

        "abstract": "Deep clustering is the first method to handle general audio separation scenarios with multiple sources of the same type and an arbitrary number of sources, performing impressively in speaker-independent speech separation tasks. However, little is known about its effectiveness in other challenging situations such as music source separation. Contrary to conventional networks that directly estimate the source signals, deep clustering generates an embedding for each time-frequency bin, and separates sources by clustering the bins in the embedding space. We show that deep clustering outperforms conventional networks on a singing voice separation task, in both matched and mismatched conditions, even though conventional networks have the advantage of end-to-end training for best signal approximation, presumably because its more flexible objective engenders better regularization. Since the strengths of deep clustering and conventional network architectures appear complementary, we explore combining them in a single hybrid network trained via an approach akin to multi-task learning. Remarkably, the combination significantly outperforms either of its components.",

        "abstract": "Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be remarkably powerful at language modelling, achieving impressive results on numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training. Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT \u201cknows\u201d about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze the knowledge stored in BERT\u2019s parameters, we use different probes (i.e., tasks to examine a trained model regarding certain properties) that require different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT\u2019s Masked Language Modelling (MLM) head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts. In addition, we employ BERT\u2019s Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head and representations\u2019 similarity (SIM) to compare relevant and non-relevant search and recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in a conversational recommendation downstream task. To this end, we fine-tune BERT to act as a retrieval-based CRS. Overall, our experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational recommendation when faced with adversarial data.",

This allows for searching for relevant music pieces by issuing descriptive textual queries. In this paper, we examine the effects of incorporating audio-based similarity into the text-based ranking process-either by directly modifying the retrieval process or by performing post-hoc audio-based re-ranking of the search results. The aim of this combination is to improve ranking quality by including relevant tracks that are left out by text-based retrieval approaches. Our evaluations show overall improvements but also expose limitations of these unsupervised approaches to combining sources. Evaluations are carried out on two collections , one large real-world collection containing about 35,000 tracks and on the CAL500 set.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this work is to explore a new method for the creative analysis and manipulation of musical audio content. Given a target song and a source song, the goal is reconstruct the harmonic and rhythmic structure of the target with the timbral components from the source, in such a way that so that both the target and the source material are recognizable by the listener. We refer to this operation as musical cross-synthesis. For this purpose, we propose the use of a Matrix Factorisation method, more specifically, Shift-Invariant Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA). The input to the PLCA algorithm are beat synchronous CQT basis functions of the source whose temporal activations are used to approximate the CQT of the target. Using the shift invariant property of the PLCA allows each basis function to be subjected to a range of possible pitch shifts which increases the flexibility of the source to represent the target. To create the resulting musical cross-synthesis the beat synchronous, pitch-shifted CQT basis functions are inverted and concatenated in time.",

The new method is also compared to some previous approaches to pitch variation correction.",

Such modalities include audio recordings, symbolic music scores, mid-level representations, motion and gestural data, video recordings, editorial or cultural tags, lyrics and album cover arts. This paper critically reviews the various approaches adopted in Music Information Processing and Retrieval, and highlights how multimodal algorithms can help Music Computing applications. First, we categorize the related literature based on the application they address. Subsequently, we analyze existing information fusion approaches, and we conclude with the set of challenges that Music Information Retrieval and Sound and Music Computing research communities should focus in the next years.",

Given that a cover may differ from the original song in timbre, tempo, structure, key, arrangement, or language of the vocals, automatically identifying cover songs in a given music collection is a rather difficult task. The music information retrieval (MIR) community has paid much attention to this task in recent years and many approaches have been proposed. This chapter comprehensively summarizes the work done in cover song identification while encompassing the background related to this area of research. The most promising strategies are reviewed and qualitatively compared under a common framework, and their evaluation methodologies are critically assessed.

This scenario opens up new opportunities and challenges in the creation of accessible instruments to include persons with disabilities into music practice. This work focuses in particular on instruments dedicated to people who can not use limbs, for whom the only means for musical expression are the voice and a small number of traditional instruments. First, a modular and adaptable conceptual framework is discussed for the design of accessible digital musical instruments targeted at performers with motor impairments. Physical interaction channels available from the neck upwards (head, mouth, eyes, brain) are analyzed in terms of potential and limitations for musical interaction. Second, a systematic survey of previously developed instruments is presented: each is analyzed in terms of design choices, physical interaction channels and related sensors, mapping strategies, performer interface and feedback. As a result of this survey, several open research directions are discussed, including the use of unconventional interaction channels, musical control mappings, multisensory feedback, design, evaluation, and adaptation.",

In this paper, we leverage multi-object semantic segmentation techniques to solve this problem. We design a time-frequency representation, which has multiple channels to jointly represent the harmonic structure and pitch saliency of a pitch activation. The transcription task therefore becomes a pixel-wise multi-task classification problem including pitch activity detection and instrument recognition. Experiments on both single- and multi-instrument data verify the competitiveness of the proposed method.",

Data collected over a six-month period included observations, interviews and the examination         of musical artefacts. This paper reports on interview methodology based on constructivist elicitation tools to understand how children ascribe meaning to improvisation and composition. It was found that         children represented these phenomena in three ways: (i) distinct forms distinguished by bodily intention; (ii) interrelated forms co-existing functionally in context; and (iii) inseparable processes.

The main goal is to analyse whether there is any agreement between a group of experts and a community, when defining a set of genres and their relationships. For this purpose, three different experiments are conducted using two datasets: the MP3.com expert taxonomy, and last.fm tags at artist level. The experimental results show a clear agreement for some components of the taxonomy (Blues, Hip-Hop), whilst in other cases (e.g. Rock) there is no correlations. Interestingly enough, the same results are found in the MIREX2007 results for audio genre classification task. Therefore, a multi\u2013faceted approach for musical genre using expert based classifications, dynamic associations derived from the wisdom of crowds, and content\u2013based analysis can improve genre classification, as well as other relevant MIR tasks such as music similarity or music recommendation.",

This paper reports on the different copyright regimes in the United States and Australia. It describes some of the current DRM systems. Against this background, the paper draws on a qualitative study to explore Australian users' experience of listening to and sharing music. A design for a good DRM has to take into account the schism between the copyright regimes and users' sharing behavior.",

The books presents a wide range of genres (rock, dance, TV soundtracks, country, pop, soul, easy listening, Turkish Arabesk) and deals with issues as broad as methodology, modernism, postmodernism, Marxism and communication.

        "abstract": "When reviewing the literature on brain substrates of music processing,\n\ta puzzling variety of findings can be stated. The traditional view\n\tof a left-right dichotomy of brain organization--assuming that in\n\tcontrast to language, music is primarily processed in the right hemisphere--was\n\tchallenged 20 years ago, when the influence of music education on\n\tbrain lateralization was demonstrated. Modern concepts emphasize\n\tthe modular organization of music cognition. According to this viewpoint,\n\tdifferent aspects of music are processed in different, although partly\n\toverlapping neuronal networks of both hemispheres. However, even\n\twhen isolating a single \"module,\" such as, for example, the perception\n\tof contours, the interindividual variance of brain substrates is\n\tenormous. To clarify the factors contributing to this variability,\n\twe conducted a longitudinal experiment comparing the effects of procedural\n\tversus explicit music teaching on brain networks. We demonstrated\n\tthat cortical activation during music processing reflects the auditory\n\t\"learning biography,\" the personal experiences accumulated over time.\n\tListening to music, learning to play an instrument, formal instruction,\n\tand professional training result in multiple, in many instances multisensory,\n\trepresentations of music, which seem to be partly interchangeable\n\tand rapidly adaptive. In summary, as soon as we consider \"real music\"\n\tapart from laboratory experiments, we have to expect individually\n\tformed and quickly adaptive brain substrates, including widely distributed\n\tneuronal networks in both hemispheres.",

A recent study recording\n\tthe mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked by pitch contour and interval\n\tdeviations in simple melodies demonstrated that people with no formal\n\tmusic education process both contour and interval information in\n\tthe auditory cortex automatically. However, it is still unclear whether\n\tmusical experience enhances both strategies of melodic encoding.\n\tWe designed stimuli to examine contour and interval information separately.\n\tIn the contour condition there were eight different standard melodies\n\t(presented on 80\\% of trials), each consisting of five notes all\n\tascending in pitch, and the corresponding deviant melodies (20\\%)\n\twere altered to descending on their final note. The interval condition\n\tused one five-note standard melody transposed to eight keys from\n\ttrial to trial, and on deviant trials the last note was raised by\n\tone whole tone without changing the pitch contour. There was also\n\ta control condition, in which a standard tone (990.7 Hz) and a deviant\n\ttone (1111.0 Hz) were presented. The magnetic counterpart of the\n\tMMN (MMNm) from musicians and nonmusicians was obtained as the difference\n\tbetween the dipole moment in response to the standard and deviant\n\ttrials recorded by magnetoencephalography. Significantly larger MMNm\n\twas present in musicians in both contour and interval conditions\n\tthan in nonmusicians, whereas MMNm in the control condition was similar\n\tfor both groups. The interval MMNm was larger than the contour MMNm\n\tin musicians. No hemispheric difference was found in either group.\n\tThe results suggest that musical training enhances the ability to\n\tautomatically register abstract changes in the relative pitch structure\n\tof melodies.",

Although there are parallels in relative pitch\n\tprocessing across age and species, there are notable differences.\n\tInfants accomplish such tasks with ease, but non-human listeners\n\trequire extensive training to achieve very modest levels of performance.\n\tIn general, human listeners process auditory sequences in a holistic\n\tmanner, and non-human listeners focus on absolute aspects of individual\n\ttones. Temporal grouping processes and categorization on the basis\n\tof rhythm are evident in non-human listeners and in human infants\n\tand adults. Although synchronization to sound patterns is thought\n\tto be uniquely human, tapping to music, synchronous firefly flashing,\n\tand other cyclic behaviors can be described by similar mathematical\n\tprinciples. We conclude that infants' music perception skills are\n\ta product of general perceptual mechanisms that are neither music-\n\tnor species-specific. Along with general-purpose mechanisms for the\n\tperceptual foundations of music, we suggest unique motivational mechanisms\n\tthat can account for the perpetuation of musical behavior in all\n\thuman societies.",

Here, we\n\tinvestigated whether these neuroplastic components of the AEP are\n\tenhanced in musicians in accordance with their musical training histories.\n\tHighly skilled violinists and pianists and nonmusician controls listened\n\tunder conditions of passive attention to violin tones, piano tones,\n\tand pure tones matched in fundamental frequency to the musical tones.\n\tCompared with nonmusician controls, both musician groups evidenced\n\tlarger N1c (latency, 138 msec) and P2 (latency, 185 msec) responses\n\tto the three types of tonal stimuli. As in training studies with\n\tnonmusicians, N1c enhancement was expressed preferentially in the\n\tright hemisphere, where auditory neurons may be specialized for processing\n\tof spectral pitch. Equivalent current dipoles fitted to the N1c and\n\tP2 field patterns localized to spatially differentiable regions of\n\tthe secondary auditory cortex, in agreement with previous findings.\n\tThese results suggest that the tuning properties of neurons are modified\n\tin distributed regions of the auditory cortex in accordance with\n\tthe acoustic training history (musical- or laboratory-based) of the\n\tsubject. Enhanced P2 and N1c responses in musicians need not be considered\n\tgenetic or prenatal markers for musical skill.",

Subjects\n\treceived either standard instructions or familiar folk-tune labels\n\tto aid performance. The folk-tune labels greatly improved identification\n\tperformance, producing expert-caliber performance by some musically\n\tinexperienced subjects. The effectiveness of the folk-tune manipulation\n\twas much more limited in a difficult discrimination task. The results\n\tsuggest that novices do have some basic competence when assayed appropriately,\n\tand that familiar musical tokens may be a critical element in such\n\tassays.

        "abstract": "Unedited I investigate the nature of, and relationships between, works, performances, and recordings in the Western musical traditions of classical, rock, and jazz music. I begin in chapter one by defending the study of musical ontology against a recent attack by Aaron Ridley. This leads into a discussion of the appropriate methodology for investigating the ontology of art, and the reasons for doing musical ontology, particularly in a comparative way. In chapter two I review and reject several theories of what a classical musical work is. I defend the view that such a work is an abstract object--a type of performance--against several objections, most notably that abstract objects cannot be created, while musical works are. In chapter three I argue that classical recordings, as they are typically made, are correctly conceived of as giving access to performances of the works they purport to be of, despite the fact that they are not records of any single performance event in the studio. Before tackling rock and jazz, in chapter four I investigate the concept of a work of art in general, arguing that there are two necessary conditions an art object must meet to be a work: (1) it must be of a kind that is a primary focus of critical attention in a given art form or tradition, and (2) it must be a persisting object. I argue further that (i) there is no need to subsume all art under the work concept, and that (ii) drawing a distinction between works and other art objects need not lead to valuing the former over the latter. In chapter five, I argue that the work of art in rock music is a track for playback, constructed in the studio. Tracks usually manifest songs, which can be performed live. A cover version is a track (successfully) intended to manifest the same song as some other track. In chapter six, I discuss various proposals for the ontology of jazz. I argue that in jazz there are no works, only performances.",

        "abstract": "We present in this paper a new approach for polyphonic music transcription using evolution strategies (ES). Automatic music transcription is a complex process that still remains an open challenge. Using an audio signal to be transcribed as target for our ES, information needed to generate a MIDI file can be extracted from this latter one. Many techniques presented in the literature at present exist and a few of them have applied evolutionary algorithms to address this problem in the context of considering it as a search space problem. However, ES have never been applied until now. The experiments showed that by using these machines learning tools, some shortcomings presented by other evolutionary algorithms based approaches for transcription can be solved. They include the computation cost and the time for convergence. As evolution strategies use self-adapting parameters, we show in this paper that by correctly tuning the value of its strategy parameter that controls the standard deviation, a fast convergence can be triggered toward the optima, which from the results performs the transcription of the music with good accuracy and in a short time. In the same context, the computation task is tackled using parallelization techniques thus reducing the computation time and the transcription time in the overall.",

Musical improvisation requires the ability to recognize constraints and also demands inventiveness. Musical improvisations on a traditional, tonal and also on a whole tone scale composition were produced by a mentally handicapped and by a normal control musician. It was found that not only the control but also the handicapped subject could improvise appropriately within structural constraints, although with the tonal music the idiot-savant showed some stylistic latitude. It is concluded that cognitive processes such as musical input analysis, decision making, and output monitoring are independent of general intellectual status.",

While these applications are a welcome tool to be used in the classrooms and research labs, their effectiveness could be improved by focusing on their usability. The usability of a user interface can be evaluated and even measured with respect to the goals of its users. In order to demonstrate the evaluation of a user interface, I present an experiment in which the efficiency of user interfaces is assessed in the context of three scenarios or ``use cases.'' Based on the experiment, I discuss some basic principles of usability theory, such as affordances, minimization of navigation, error handling, immediate feedback, and data visibility. The evaluation of these principles suggests some new types of music theory applications.",

I will show that although these three measures are in principle quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This produces the challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given music-theoretical circumstance. Since the different models can yield comparable results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).",

The latter impose various restrictions to the established music consumption behaviour, such as limitations on the number of devices and proprietary music formats. We describe a business model that is based on a liberal management of music rights, instead of the dominant restrictions of access. The proposed business model facilitates the free flow of music content between different client devices (PC, mobile phone, portable player) and between heterogeneous networks (Web, P2P, wireless, broadcast), but it controls the flow of rights for added value music bundles. The business model is presented over two stages of the customer activity cycle and along the revenue, process and technology elements.",

        "abstract": "Music is perceived and described very subjectively by every individual. Nowadays, people often get lost in their steadily growing, multi-placed, digital music collection. Existing music player and management applications get in trouble when dealing with poor metadata that is predominant in personal music collections. There are several music information services available that assist users by providing tools for precisely organising their music collection, or for presenting them new insights into their own music library and listening habits. However, it is still not the case that music consumers can seamlessly interact with all these auxiliary services directly from the place where they access their music individually. To profit from the manifold music and music-related knowledge that is or can be available via various information services, this information has to be gathered up, semantically federated, and integrated into a uniform knowledge base that can personalised represent this data in an appropriate visualisation to the users. This personalised semantic aggregation of music metadata from several sources is the gist of this thesis. The outlined solution particularly concentrates on users\u2019 needs regarding music collection management which can strongly alternate between single human beings. The author\u2019s proposal, the personal music knowledge base (PMKB), consists of a client-server architecture with uniform communication endpoints and an ontological knowledge representation model format that is able to represent the versatile information of its use cases. The PMKB concept is appropriate to cover the complete information flow life cycle, including the processes of user account initialisation, information service choice, individual information extraction, and proactive update notification. The PMKB implementation makes use of SemanticWeb technologies. Particularly the knowledge representation part of the PMKB vision is explained in this work. Several new Semantic Web ontologies are defined or existing ones are massively modified to meet the requirements of a personalised semantic federation of music and music-related data for managing personal music collections. The outcome is, amongst others, \u2022 a new vocabulary for describing the play back domain, \u2022 another one for representing information service categorisations and quality ratings, and \u2022 one that unites the beneficial parts of the existing advanced user modelling ontologies. The introduced vocabularies can be perfectly utilised in conjunction with the existing Music Ontology framework. Some RDFizers that also make use of the outlined ontologies in their mapping definitions, illustrate the fitness in practise of these specifications. A social evaluation method is applied to carry out an examination dealing with the reutilisation, application and feedback of the vocabularies that are explained in this work. This analysis shows that it is a good practise to properly publish Semantic Web ontologies with the help of some Linked Data principles and further basic SEO techniques to easily reach the searching audience, to avoid duplicates of such KR specifications, and, last but not least, to directly establish a \"shared understanding\". Due to their project-independence, the proposed vocabularies can be deployed in every knowledge representation model that needs their knowledge representation capacities. This thesis added its value to make the vision of a personal music knowledge base come true.",

This survey research aimed to explore the reasons why people listen to their personal stereo while engaged in physical activity, and to understand the effect this has on their level of enjoyment. Three hundred and forty six students participated in this study via convenience sampling. Participants were divided into groups depending on their active usage of a personal stereo. The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was administered as the instrument. An independent-samples t test comparing the PACES mean scores of the Non-Personal Stereo and the Personal Stereo groups found a significant difference between the two groups (t(322)= -5.338, p<.0005). Participants in the Personal Stereo group reported that they felt more energized, they enjoyed their experiences more, and that they preferred being in control of the music they listened to. Overall the results suggested that that listening to self-selected music can enhance individuals\u2019 physical activity enjoyment.",

Well-formedness is defined in terms of a relationship between the order in which a single interval generates the elements of a pitch-class set and the order in which those elements appear in a scale. Another characterization provides a recursive procedure for organizing all well-formed scales into hierarchies. Finally, well-formed scales are defined in terms of scale-step measure, and aspects of the diatonic set are examined.",

Serial compositional methods \u2014 developed dialectically in the search for continual transitions with the help of distinct musical elements \u2014 are enriched by the scientific model of the unity of the acoustic world as it was formulated by Werner Meyer-Eppler.

Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.",

        "abstract": "We propose to pre-stack a U-Net as a way of improving the polyphonic music transcription performance of various baseline Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS). The U-Net, a network architecture based on skip-connections between layers acts as a transformation network followed by a transcription network. Notably, we do not introduce any additional loss terms specific to the transformation network, but instead, jointly train the entire combined model with the original loss function that was designed for the back-end transcription network. We argue that this U-Net network transforms the input signal into a representation that is more effective for transcription, and thus enables the observed improvements in accuracy. We empirically confirm with several experiments using the MusicNet dataset, that the proposed configuration consistently improves the accuracy of transcription networks. This enhancement cannot be achieved by simply introducing more neurons or more layers to the baseline CNNs. Moreover, we show that using the proposed architecture we can go beyond general music transcription and perform transcription in an instrument-specific fashion. By doing so, the original general transcription performance is also increased.",

It shows how price norms constitute an important reference point for individual workers in navigating the labour market. However, only rarely do they take \u2018stronger\u2019 form as a collective demand. Two further arguments are made: first, that the strength of norms varies very widely across labour markets, being much stronger on jobs where other qualitative attractions (such as the scope for creative autonomy) are weak. Second, in the Paris case, an ostensibly solidaristic social insurance mechanism (the Intermittence du Spectacle system) had the seemingly paradoxical effect of further weakening social norms around working conditions. Workers\u2019 individual efforts to meet the system\u2019s eligibility criteria often disrupted the emergence of collective expectations around pricing, and in some cases the existence of formal regulation itself was stigmatized as stifling creativity.",

Review texts are further enriched with named entity disambiguation along with polarity information derived from an aspect-based sentiment analysis framework. This dataset constitutes the cornerstone of two main contributions: First, we perform experiments on music genre classification, exploring a variety of feature types, including semantic, sentimental and acoustic features. These experiments show that modeling semantic information contributes to outperforming strong bag-of-words baselines. Second, we provide a diachronic study of the criticism of music genres via a quantitative analysis of the polarity associated to musical aspects over time. Our analysis hints at a potential correlation between key cultural and geopolitical events and the language and evolving sentiments found in music reviews.",

        "abstract": "We present MATCH, a toolkit for aligning audio recordings of different renditions of the same piece of music, based on an efficient implementation of a dynamic time warping algorithm. A forward path estimation algorithm constrains the alignment path so that dynamic time warping can be performed with time and space costs that are linear in the size of the audio files. Frames of audio are represented by a positive spectral difference vector, which emphasises note onsets in the alignment process. MATCH was tested on several hundred test cases and had a median error of 20 ms, with less than 1% of test cases failing to align at all. The software is useful for content-based indexing of audio files and for the study of performance interpretation; it can also be used in real-time for tracking live performances. Another possible application is in an intelligent audio recording and editing system for aligning splice points. The toolkit also provides functions for displaying the cost matrix, the forward and backward paths, and any metadata associated with the recordings, which can be shown in real time as the alignment is computed.",

To\n\taccomplish this, it i s reasonable to study how humans are able to\n\tperform this task, and to assess what features we use to determine\n\tmelodic similarity. Research has shown that melodic contour is an\n\timportant feature in determining melodic similarity, but it i s also\n\tclear that rhythmic information is important as well. The goal of\n\tthis research is to explore what variation of contour and rhythmic\n\tinformation can result in the most efficient, robust, and scalable\n\trepresentation for melody.

This time away from\n\tformal feedback leaves them prone to the development of bad technical\n\tand practice habits, to burnout from the solitary nature of practice,\n\tand to a lack of external motivation to improve. Furthermore, the\n\tgreat deal of time and effort required to master a musical instrument\n\tamplifies the effects of inefficient practice, and the highly complex\n\tnature of the material being learned can both lead to subjective\n\tand vague and the belief in the need for excessively long hours of\n\trepetitive practice to acquire technical skills. These factors can\n\thave negative consequences for the learner, ranging from frustration\n\tstemming from lack of progress, high abandonment rates, and psychological\n\tand physiological health problems. Game-based learning solutions\n\tare well-suited to address the challenges experienced by student,\n\tcapitalizing on constant advances in technology such as the use of\n\timmersive or embodied controllers and interfaces that use gesture\n\trecognition as input. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art\n\tin the use of game-based learning practices and tools (e.g. serious\n\tgames) in music learning, taking the violin as a case study. It finds\n\tthat, while progress is being made, relatively little has been done\n\tto leverage game-based learning to improve musicians' experience.\n\tThe paper will outline the requirements and pitfalls associated to\n\tthe culture of high performance and mainstream music students and\n\tconclude with a series of recommendations for those developing-game\n\tbased learning solutions.

        "abstract": "Expression is an important aspect of music performance. It is the\n\tadded value of a performance and is part of the reason that music\n\tis interesting to listen to and sounds alive. Understanding and modeling\n\texpressive content communication is important for many engineering\n\tapplications in information technology. For example, in multimedia\n\tproducts, textual information is enriched by means of graphical and\n\taudio objects. In this paper, we present an original approach to\n\tmodify the expressive content of a performance in a gradual way,\n\tboth at the symbolic and signal levels. To this purpose, we discuss\n\ta model that applies a smooth morphing among performances with different\n\texpressive content, adapting the audio expressive character to the\n\tuser's desires. Morphing can be realized with a wide range of graduality\n\t(from abrupt to very smooth), allowing adaptation of the system to\n\tdifferent situations. The sound rendering is obtained by interfacing\n\tthe expressiveness model with a dedicated postprocessing environment,\n\twhich allows for the transformation of the event cues. The processing\n\tis based on the organized control of basic audio effects. Among the\n\tbasic effects used, an original method for the spectral processing\n\tof audio is introduced.",

This part is typically related to dissonance between\n\tmusical parts and musical instruments. In this paper, we propose\n\ta novel model for extracting the main melody from multi-part musical\n\tscores. This model is referred to as the TuneRank model that has\n\tthe conceptually similar idea of the PageRank model. If each musical\n\tnote can be considered like a web page in the Internet, and the dissonance\n\tvalue between two notes is like the quantity of links between two\n\tweb pages. The TuneRank (rank of becoming main melody) of each note\n\tis calculated using Markov transition probability. This model is\n\ttested on the ECPK4 database. By comparing to the previous work,\n\twe find that this note-based model is more effective for processing\n\tscores containing main melody in multiple parts. Also, the accuracy\n\tdoes not change with the increase of the number of parts. In general,\n\tthis model can be used for extracting the single-part main melody\n\tof digital musical scores.",

        "abstract": "For centuries, music has been shared and remem- bered by two traditions:\n\taural transmission and in the form of written documents normally\n\tcalled musical scores. Many of these scores exist in the form of\n\tunpublished manuscripts and hence they are in danger of being lost\n\tthrough the nor- mal ravages of time. To preserve the music some\n\tform of typesetting or, ideally, a computer system that can automat-\n\tically decode the symbolic images and create new scores is required.\n\tPrograms analogous to optical character recogni- tion systems called\n\toptical music recognition (OMR) sys- tems have been under intensive\n\tdevelopment for many years. However, the results to date are far\n\tfrom ideal. Each of the proposed methods emphasizes different properties\n\tand there- fore makes it difficult to effectively evaluate its competitive\n\tadvantages.This article provides an overviewof the literature concerning\n\tthe automatic analysis of images of printed and handwritten musical\n\tscores. For self-containment and for the benefit of the reader, an\n\tintroduction toOMRprocessing sys- tems precedes the literature overview.\n\tThe following study presents a reference scheme for any researcher\n\twanting to compare new OMR algorithms against well-known ones.",

After suitably normalizing\nthis data, we use it to test three hypotheses related to the geographic flow of\nmusic. The first is that although many of the most popular artists are listened\nto around the world, music preferences are closely related to nationality,\nlanguage, and geographic location. We find support for this hypothesis, with a\ncouple of minor, yet interesting, exceptions. Our second hypothesis is that\nsome cities are consistently early adopters of new music (and early to snub\nstale music). To test this hypothesis, we adapt a method previously used to\ndetect the leadership networks present in flocks of birds. We find empirical\nsupport for the claim that a similar leadership network exists among cities,\nand this finding is the main contribution of the paper. Finally, we test the\nhypothesis that large cities tend to be ahead of smaller cities-we find only\nweak support for this hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Most work on automatic transcription produces \u201cpiano roll\u201d data with no musical interpretation of the rhythm or pitches. We present a polyphonic transcription method that converts a music audio signal into a human-readable musical score, by integrating multi-pitch detection and rhythm quantization methods. This integration is made difficult by the fact that the multi-pitch detection produces erroneous notes such as extra notes and introduces timing errors that are added to temporal deviations due to musical expression. Thus, we propose a rhythm quantization method that can remove extra notes by extending the metrical hidden Markov model and optimize the model parameters. We also improve the note-tracking process of multi-pitch detection by refining the treatment of repeated notes and adjustment of onset times. Finally, we propose evaluation measures for transcribed scores. Systematic evaluations on commonly used classical piano data show that these treatments improve the performance of transcription, which can be used as benchmarks for further studies.",

        "abstract": "Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of matching symbolic representations directly to audio based representations for applications that use data from both domains. One such application is score alignment, which aligns a sequence of frames based on features such as chroma vectors and distance functions such as Euclidean distance. Good representations are critical, yet current systems use ad hoc constructions such as the chromagram that have been shown to work quite well. We investigate ways to learn chromagram-like representations that optimize the classification of \u201cmatching \u201d vs. \u201cnon-matching \u201d frame pairs of audio and MIDI. New representations learned automatically from examples not only perform better than the chromagram representation but they also reveal interesting projection structures that differ distinctly from the traditional chromagram. 1.",

However, selecting the most relevant items (albums, artists, playlists...) to display in these carousels is a challenging task, as items are numerous and as users have different preferences. In this paper, we model carousel personalization as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays, stochastic arm display and delayed batch feedback. We empirically show the effectiveness of our framework at capturing characteristics of real-world carousels by addressing a large-scale playlist recommendation task on a global music streaming mobile app. Along with this paper, we publicly release industrial data from our experiments, as well as an open-source environment to simulate comparable carousel personalization learning problems.",

        "abstract": "Music streaming platforms are currently among the main sources of music consumption, and the embedded recommender systems significantly influence what the users consume. There is an increasing interest to ensure that those platforms and systems are fair. Yet, we first need to understand what fairness means in such a context. Although artists are the main content providers for music platforms, there is a research gap concerning the artists' perspective. To fill this gap, we conducted interviews with music artists to understand how they are affected by current platforms and what improvements they deem necessary. Using a Qualitative Content Analysis, we identify the aspects that the artists consider relevant for fair platforms. In this paper, we discuss the following aspects derived from the interviews: fragmented presentation, reaching an audience, transparency, influencing users' listening behavior, popularity bias, artists' repertoire size, quotas for local music, gender balance, and new music. For some topics, our findings do not indicate a clear direction about the best way how music platforms should act and function; for other topics, though, there is a clear consensus among our interviewees: for these, the artists have a clear idea of the actions that should be taken so that music platforms will be fair also for the artists.",

This article introduces a hybrid intelligence system, that ameliorates the current situation by combining the intelligence of humans and machines. This study proposes design requirements for hybrid intelligence systems in the music industry. Using a design science research approach, we identify design requirements both inductively from expert interviews and deductively from theory and present a first prototypical instantiation of a respective hybrid intelligence system. Overall, this shall enrich the body of knowledge of hybrid intelligence research by transferring its concepts into a new context. Furthermore, the identified design requirements shall serve as a foundation for researchers and practitioners to further explore and design hybrid intelligence in the music industry and beyond.",

In this work, we propose an early example of semantic text-based music search engine. The semantic description takes into account emotional and non-emotional musical aspects. The method also includes a query-by-similarity search approach performed using semantic cues. We model both concepts and musical content in dimensional spaces that are suitable for carrying intensity information on the descriptors. We process the semantic query with a Natural Language parser to capture only the relevant words and qualifiers. We rely on Bayesian Decision theory to model concepts and songs as probability distributions. The resulted ranked list of songs are produced through a posterior probability model. A prototype of the system has been proposed to 53 subjects for evaluation, with good ratings on performance, usefulness and potential. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

These\r\napproaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various\r\ntime-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the\r\ncross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes\r\nconditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot\r\naccurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we\r\nintroduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the\r\ntime-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the\r\nground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement\r\nin both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a\r\nstate-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial\r\nlearning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the\r\nconfidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to\r\nany transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common\r\nin music signal analysis.",

In this\n\tpaper we present and evaluate heuristics to adapt playlists automatically\n\tgiven a song to start with (seed song) and immediate user feedback.\n\tInstead of rich metadata we use audio-based similarity. The user\n\tgives feedback by pressing a skip button if the user dislikes the\n\tcurrent song. Songs similar to skipped songs are removed, while songs\n\tsimilar to accepted ones are added to the playlist. We evaluate the\n\theuristics with hypothetical use cases. For each use case we assume\n\ta specific user behavior (e.g. the user always skips songs by a particular\n\tartist). Our results show that using audio similarity and simple\n\theuristics it is possible to drastically reduce the number of necessary\n\tskips.",

The proposed work\n                  detaches from former works by classifying music based\n                  on music score information. Text Mining techniques\n                  support music score processing while Classification\n                  techniques are used in the construction of decision\n                  models. Although research is still at its earliest\n                  beginnings, the work already provides valuable\n                  contributes to symbolic music representation processing \n                  and subsequent analysis. Score processing involved\n                  the counting of ascending and descending chromatic\n                  intervals, note duration and meta-information\n                  tagging. Analysis involved feature selection and\n                  the evaluation of several data mining algorithms,\n                  ensuring extensibility towards larger repositories or\n                  more complex problems.

However, past techniques developed\n                 for IEC-based composition have not necessarily proven\n                 very effective for professional use. This is due to the\n                 large difference between data representation used by\n                 IEC and authored classical music composition. To solve\n                 this difficulties, the authors purpose a new IEC\n                 approach to music composition based on classical music\n                 theory. In this paper, the authors describe an\n                 established system according to the above idea, and\n                 detail of making success of composition a piece.",

The article proposes an alternative to two approaches which have dominated the sociological and anthropological discussion of music: one which suggests that music simply reproduces social conditions; and another which suggests that it opposes them. Here I argue that the temporalities created through music constitute a form of engagement with experiences of time and history generated elsewhere.",

This paper\r\nconsiders several objections to (a) and fi nds them lacking. I then consider improvised\r\nmusic, a subject that Mag Uidhir explicitly brackets in his discussion.

Neuroscience research has\n\tshown that music training leads to changes throughout the auditory\n\tsystem that prime musicians for listening challenges beyond music\n\tprocessing. This effect of music training suggests that, akin to\n\tphysical exercise and its impact on body fitness, music is a resource\n\tthat tones the brain for auditory fitness. Therefore, the role of\n\tmusic in shaping individual development deserves consideration.",

        "abstract": "Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1% of all digital tracks accounted for 80% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50% of all album sales, and 80% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail. Current music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms tend to recommend popular -or well-known to the user- music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to make accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided recommendations. In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user's perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity to predict -potentially-interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and relevant material (non-obvious recommendations), taken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution. The main contributions of this Thesis are: <i>(i)</i> a novel network-based approach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, <i>(ii)</i> a user-centric evaluation that measures the user's relevance and novelty of the recommendations, and <i>(iii)</i> two prototype systems that implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work. Our findings have significant implications for recommender systems that assist users to explore the Long Tail, digging for content they might like.",

        "abstract": "Youth music is the most creative and contested location on the cultural landscape.  It is a vehicle for generational moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of the corporate state's main theatres for national moral panic.  Today's sounds, and the debates about their various forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the last two decades:  class polarization, racial marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced opportunities in life.  Youth culture is still responding to these uneven developments with a passion that has been romanticized by some critics as a significant form of resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of direct and political protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and interviews, brings together some of the best known scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on the contemporary scene.  It includes theoretical discussions of musical history along with social commentaries about genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene.  The contents of the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they are also designed to address audiences reached by mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical taste.",

This contribution aims at illustrating the part of the project regarding the implementation of the prototype for the metadata and text encoding, indexing and visualisation of Bellini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correspondence. The encoding scheme has been defined according to the latest guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative and it has been instantiated on a sample of letters. Contextually, a first environment has been implemented by customizing two open source tools: Edition Visualization Technology and Omega Scholarly platform. The main objective of the digital edition is to engage general public with the cultural heritage held by the Belliniano Civic Museum of Catania. This wide access to Bellini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correspondence has been conceived preserving the scholarly transcriptions of the letters edited by Seminara within her most recent critical edition (Olschki, 2017). The digital edition of the corpus takes care of handling the correspondence metadata by means of the correspDesc TEI tagset. Finally, Bellini's letters will be accessible via the Web platform as well as integrated into a forthcoming interactive and multimedia tour hosted at the museum.",

        "abstract": "Beat induction is best described by analogy to the activities of hand\n\tclapping or foot tapping, and involves finding important metrical\n\tcomponents in an auditory signal, usually music. Though beat induction\n\tis intuitively easy to understand it is difficult to define and still\n\tmore difficult to perform automatically. We will present a model\n\tof beat induction that uses a spiking neural network as the underlying\n\tsynchronization mechanism. This approach has some advantages over\n\texisting methods; it runs online, responds at many levels in the\n\tmetrical hierarchy, and produces good results on performed music\n\t(Beatles piano performances encoded as MIDI). In this paper the model\n\tis described in some detail and simulation results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "In general music composed by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffers\n\tfrom a lack of global structure. Though networks can learn note-by-note\n\ttransition probabilities and even reproduce phrases, attempts at\n\tlearning an entire musical form and using that knowledge to guide\n\tcomposition have been unsuccessful. The reason for this failure seems\n\tto be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that\n\tindicate global music structure. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has\n\tsucceeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as\n\ttiming & counting and CSL learning. In the current study I show\n\tthat LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music.\n\tI compare this approach to previous attempts, with particular focus\n\ton issues of data representation. I present experimental results\n\tshowing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is\n\table to compose novel (and I believe pleasing) melodies in that style.\n\tRemarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure it\n\tdoes not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good\n\ttiming and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.\n\t\n\t Note: This is a more complete version of the 2002 ICANN submission\n\tLearning the Long-Term Structure of the Blues.",

        "abstract": "Smith's 1975 recording of the garage-band classic Gloria is less a cover version of the 1965 original--written by Van Morrison and performed by Them--than a complete reconfiguration. Smith simultaneously parodies and pays tribute to the oft-covered song by radically altering the lyrics and vocal delivery. Her recording serves as both a critique and a celebration of the male-dominated rock aesthetic that preceded her own work. A full transcription of Smith's version is included, highlighting the central communicative role of the voice in popular music. A newly devised notational scheme that indicates vocal timbre and microtonal inflections is used to track Smith's vocal delivery. A phonetic transcription of the text as delivered by Smith replicates her variant pronunciations and interpretations of Morrison's lyrics. Julia Kristeva's concept of intertextuality is used as a tool for unpacking the complexities of the performance. The multilayered nature of Smith's Gloria mixes contrasting styles of linguistic and musical discourse, transforming Morrison's song from a stand-alone text to a manipulated signifier.",

        "abstract": "In a seminal 1985 article, Robert Hatten outlines a theory of musical intertextuality with the potential for a broad range of application. He suggests that intertextuality in music operates on two essential levels: stylistic and strategic. Stylistic intertextuality occurs when a composer adopts distinctive features of an earlier style without reference to any specific work in that style (such as the appropriation of high-Baroque devices in the string-octet accompaniment to McCartney's Eleanor Rigby). Strategic intertextuality is more pointed, occurring only when a composer makes deliberate reference to a particular earlier work or works, and this can involve a variety of techniques such as quotation, structural modeling, variation, or paraphrase. At the risk of oversimplification, we might say then that the goal of an intertextual analysis is to unravel the many ways in which the stylistic and strategic references contribute to the meaning of the new piece. Analyses of three of Lennon's late Beatles songs--All you need is love, Glass onion, and Because--demonstrate how strategic intertextuality can work to enrich a pop-rock song's overall message.",

        "abstract": "The role of expectation in listening and composing music has drawn\r\n\tmuch attention in music cognition since about half a century ago.\r\n\tIn this paper, we provide a first attempt to model some aspects of\r\n\tmusical expectation specifically pertained to short-time and working\r\n\tmemories, in an anticipatory framework. In our proposition Anticipation\r\n\tis the mental realization of possible predicted actions and their\r\n\teffect on the perception of the world at an instant in time. We demonstrate\r\n\tthe model in applications to automatic improvisation and style imitation.\r\n\tThe proposed model, based on cognitive foundations of musical expectation,\r\n\tis an active model using reinforcement learning techniques with multiple\r\n\tagents that learn competitively and in collaboration. We show that\r\n\tcompared to similar models, this anticipatory framework needs little\r\n\ttraining data and demonstrate complex musical behavior such as long-term\r\n\tplanning and formal shapes as a result of the anticipatory architecture.\r\n\tWe provide sample results and discuss further research.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To measure biologic effects of music, noise, and healing\n\tenergy without human preferences or placebo effects using seed germination\n\tas an objective biomarker.METHODS:A series of five experiments were\n\tperformed utilizing okra and zucchini seeds germinated in acoustically\n\tshielded, thermally insulated, dark, humid growth chambers. Conditions\n\tcompared were an untreated control, musical sound, pink noise, and\n\thealing energy. Healing energy was administered for 15-20 minutes\n\tevery 12 hours with the intention that the treated seeds would germinate\n\tfaster than the untreated seeds. The objective marker was the number\n\tof seeds sprouted out of groups of 25 seeds counted at 12-hour intervals\n\tover a 72-hour growing period. Temperature and relative humidity\n\twere monitored every 15 minutes inside the seed germination containers.\n\tA total of 14 trials were run testing a total of 4600 seeds.RESULTS:Musical\n\tsound had a highly statistically significant effect on the number\n\tof seeds sprouted compared to the untreated control over all five\n\texperiments for the main condition (p < 0.002) and over time (p <\n\t0.000002). This effect was independent of temperature, seed type,\n\tposition in room, specific petri dish, and person doing the scoring.\n\tMusical sound had a significant effect compared to noise and an untreated\n\tcontrol as a function of time (p < 0.03) while there was no significant\n\tdifference between seeds exposed to noise and an untreated control.\n\tHealing energy also had a significant effect compared to an untreated\n\tcontrol (main condition, p < 0.0006) and over time (p < 0.0001) with\n\ta magnitude of effect comparable to that of musical sound.CONCLUSION:This\n\tstudy suggests that sound vibrations (music and noise) as well as\n\tbiofields (bioelectromagnetic and healing intention) both directly\n\taffect living biologic systems, and that a seed germination bioassay\n\thas the sensitivity to enable detection of effects caused by various\n\tapplied energetic conditions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Due to auditory experience, musicians have better auditory expertise than non-musicians. An increased neocortical activity during auditory oddball stimulation was observed in different studies for musicians and for non-musicians after discrimination training. This suggests a modification of synaptic strength among simultaneously active neurons due to the training. We used amplitude-modulated tones (AM) presented in an oddball sequence and manipulated their carrier or modulation frequencies. We investigated non-musicians in order to see if behavioral discrimination training could modify the neocortical activity generated by change detection of AM tone attributes (carrier or modulation frequency). Cortical evoked responses like N1 and mismatch negativity (MMN) triggered by sound changes were recorded by a whole head magnetoencephalographic system (MEG). We investigated (i) how the auditory cortex reacts to pitch difference (in carrier frequency) and changes in temporal features (modulation frequency) of AM tones and (ii) how discrimination training modulates the neuronal activity reflecting the transient auditory responses generated in the auditory cortex.RESULTS:The results showed that, additionally to an improvement of the behavioral discrimination performance, discrimination training of carrier frequency changes significantly modulates the MMN and N1 response amplitudes after the training. This process was accompanied by an attention switch to the deviant stimulus after the training procedure identified by the occurrence of a P3a component. In contrast, the training in discrimination of modulation frequency was not sufficient to improve the behavioral discrimination performance and to alternate the cortical response (MMN) to the modulation frequency change. The N1 amplitude, however, showed significant increase after and one week after the training. Similar to the training in carrier frequency discrimination, a long lasting involuntary attention to the deviant stimulus was observed.CONCLUSION:We found that discrimination training differentially modulates the cortical responses to pitch changes and to envelope fluctuation changes of AM tones. This suggests that discrimination between AM tones requires additional neuronal mechanisms compared to discrimination process between pure tones. After the training, the subjects demonstrated an involuntary attention switch to the deviant stimulus (represented by the P3a-component in the MEG) even though attention was not prerequisite.",

Once vertices are assigned locations in a Euclidean space,\r\nthe locations can be used to browse music and to generate playlists.\r\nMDS on very large sparse graphs can be effectively performed by a\r\nfamily of algorithms called Rectangular Dijsktra (RD) MDS algorithms.\r\nThese RD algorithms operate on a dense rectangular slice of the distance\r\nmatrix, created by calling Dijsktra a constant number of times. Two RD\r\nalgorithms are compared: Landmark MDS, which uses the Nystr\u00f6m ap-\r\nproximation to perform MDS; and a new algorithm called Fast Sparse\r\nEmbedding, which uses FastMap. These algorithms compare favorably\r\nto Laplacian Eigenmaps, both in terms of speed and embedding quality.",

        "abstract": "Current location-based services (LBS) typically allow users to locate points of interest (POI) in their vicinity but can detract from the user's emotional experience of exploring a new location. In this paper, we examine how cues in the form of popular music (musicons) can emotionally engage users and enhance their experience of discovering nearby POIs serendipitously in unfamiliar places. The primary contribution of this paper is a field study, in which we evaluate the performance and emotional engagement of different types of audio-based cues for directing users' attention to specific POIs. Musicons and mixed-modality cues performed close to visual and speech cues, and significantly better than auditory icons, for POI identification while creating a much more pleasant and engaging user experience. We conclude that cues for POI discovery need not always be as explicit as the baseline visual cues. Indeed, the most challenging cues, auditory icons, led to a heightened sense of autonomy.",
